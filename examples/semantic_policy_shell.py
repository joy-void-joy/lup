"""Refuse a denied command inside a live session — the tool-call path.

The tool-call half of the policy pair; ``semantic_policy`` is the fetch
half. The shell policy consults the same declared origin table, so the URL
refused to a fetch is refused to ``curl`` as well and no command reaches a
shell by taking the other route.

The session runs with permissions bypassed, which is the mode where this
hook is the only gate the call meets: what the policy denies is refused,
and nothing else is left to grant it.
