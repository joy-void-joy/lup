"""Refuse a denied fetch inside a live session, not on a printout.

The fetch half of the policy pair; ``semantic_policy_shell`` is the
tool-call half. Both declare the same origin table and enforce it through
the session's own hook seam, so the URL a policy denies is a URL the
session cannot retrieve.

The session runs with permissions bypassed, which is the mode where this
hook is the only gate the call meets: what the policy denies is refused,
and nothing else is left to grant it.
