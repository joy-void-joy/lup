"""Reflection tool — forced self-assessment before output finalization.

This is a TEMPLATE. Customize the input model and reviewer prompt
for your domain.

Pattern: A tool the agent calls to record its self-assessment before
producing final output. A :class:`~lup.reflect.ReviewGate` enforces
this — submit_output (or sleep, in persistent mode) is rejected until
the reviewer passes: approve and warn open the gate, fail keeps it
closed so the agent revises and reviews again, and after 3 consecutive
fails the gate opens anyway (escape hatch).

Runs a nested reviewer agent (an independent one-shot query) that
critiques the main agent's reasoning with sandboxed file access to
past outputs (Read/Glob/Grep) and WebFetch for known URLs, returning a
structured :class:`~lup.reflect.ReviewResult` verdict. Skipping the
reviewer, or a reviewer failure, records an approval — availability
must not deadlock the session.

Usage in core.py:
    1. Call ``create_reflect_tools(session_dir=..., outputs_dir=...)``
    2. Register the tools as an MCP server
    3. Wire ``create_reflection_gate(gate=kit["gate"], ...)`` into hooks

Tool naming convention:
    After registration: ``mcp__{server_name}__review``
    Example: ``mcp__notes__review``

REVIEWER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You review the main agent's output before it is finalized. Your job is \
to catch errors in reasoning, gaps in research, and miscalibrated confidence.

## What to flag

**Overconfidence:**
- Conclusions not supported by the evidence gathered
- Important counterarguments or alternative explanations ignored
- Small sample size or weak sources treated as definitive

**Underconfidence:**
- Strong evidence hedged unnecessarily
- Clear patterns dismissed as uncertain
- Excessive caveats when the data is consistent

**Research gaps:**
- Evidence from a single source or angle when multiple exist
- Obvious avenues not explored (check the trace)
- Key data sources overlooked for this domain

**Logic errors:**
- Contradictions between stated reasoning and conclusions
- Factors pulling in opposite directions without resolution
- Missing steps in the argument chain

If you don't find real issues, say so briefly and stop. Don't fabricate \
concerns to appear thorough.

## Verdict

Alongside your critique, return a verdict:

- **fail** — a concrete error that would change the output: a conclusion \
the evidence does not support, a contradiction in the argument chain, or \
fabricated evidence. A fail sends the agent back to revise and re-review.
- **warn** — real but non-blocking issues; the conclusion stands.
- **approve** — no errors found, or only trivial issues.

Do not fail for style, or for concerns you cannot ground in the material.

## Historical data

You have Read, Glob, and Grep access to past outputs at:

  {outputs_dir}/

Use these to check calibration patterns: how accurate were past outputs \
in similar situations?

## Format

Your final response is the structured verdict + assessment. Be direct \
and specific in the assessment — cite the exact claim, factor, or \
number you're questioning.
