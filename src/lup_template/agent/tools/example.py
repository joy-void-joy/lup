"""Example MCP tools showing the tool pattern and Data Augmentation.

This is a TEMPLATE. Create your own tools following this pattern.

Key patterns:
1. Use @lup_tool(description, InputModel, OutputModel) decorator
2. Define input/output schemas as BaseModel with Field(description=...)
3. Handler receives a validated model instance (not a raw dict)
4. Handler must return a BaseModel instance (auto-serialized to MCP response)
5. Tool name defaults to the function name; override with name="..."
6. Metrics (duration, errors) are tracked automatically
7. tags=["requires:<service>"] marks tools that need an API key —
   ToolPolicy.filter_tools drops them when the key is missing, so the
   agent never sees tools it cannot use (see search_example below)

These tools are also the canonical template for the Data Augmentation
pattern (PATTERNS.md § Data Augmentation): enrich external data inside
the tool so the agent receives structured, domain-aware results — never
raw HTML or half-empty records. Each of the three forms has a concrete
demonstration here:

- Domain dispatch — ``fetch_example`` routes known hosts to a
  specialized handler (``fetch_wiki_article``) instead of returning raw
  HTML for the agent to parse
- Null-filling — ``search_example`` recovers snippet fields the primary
  source omits from a fallback source (``fill_missing_snippets``)
  inside the tool
- Extraction — ``fetch_example`` distills a fetched page down to a
  focused answer through a nested ``query()`` call (``extract_answer``)
  when the caller passes ``extract`` (see PATTERNS.md § Nested Agent)

Tool descriptions are the agent's only documentation for each tool.
A terse description forces the agent to guess when/why to use a tool,
which leads to misuse or underuse. A good description answers:
  - WHAT: What does this tool do? (concrete behavior)
  - WHEN: When should the agent use it? (triggers, conditions)
  - WHY: Why does this tool exist? (what problem it solves)
This keeps tool knowledge in the tool itself rather than in the prompt,
so descriptions stay accurate as tools are added or changed.
