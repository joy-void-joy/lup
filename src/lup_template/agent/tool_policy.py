"""Decide which tools the agent is allowed to use this session.

This is a TEMPLATE. Customize for your domain.

A tool may be unavailable because its dependency is unmet — an API key the
settings don't carry, a mode that forbids it. :class:`ToolPolicy` is the one
place that decision lives, so a tool that needs a key you haven't configured
simply never reaches the agent (it can't call a tool that would only fail).

The machinery (tag filtering, group predicates, server assembly, the
hook-enforced allowlist) lives in :class:`lup.tool_policy.BaseToolPolicy`;
this subclass only maps the application's settings onto exclusions. See
the base class for the tag-vs-name rule of thumb.

Usage:
    from lup.hooks import create_tool_allowlist_hook
    from lup_template.agent.config import settings
    from lup_template.agent.tool_policy import ToolPolicy

    policy = ToolPolicy(settings)
    mcp_servers = policy.get_mcp_servers(*lup_servers)
    hooks = create_tool_allowlist_hook(policy.get_allowed_tools(mcp_servers))

    Determines which tools are available based on:
    - API key availability (from settings)
    - Mode configuration (e.g., restricted mode)
    - Session context (e.g., allow certain tools only in some contexts)
    - Host shell: raw shell (Bash) is dropped unless ``AGENT_SANDBOX_ALLOW_SHELL``

      path, so host shell is never granted implicitly, sandbox present or not.

    ``group_enabled`` to gate groups on your domain's conditions (e.g. a
