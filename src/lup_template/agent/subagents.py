"""Subagent definitions.

This is a TEMPLATE. Define subagents for specialized tasks in your domain.

Subagents are spawned by the main agent to perform focused work.
Each subagent has:
- A specialized prompt (focused on one job)
- A subset of tools (only what it needs)
- Its own model (cheaper models for simpler tasks)

Definitions use SubagentSpec (SDK-agnostic). Each backend interprets
the same spec list:

- Claude: converted to native ``AgentDefinition`` via
  :func:`~lup.adapters.clients.claude.spec_to_claude`
- Codex/OpenAI: served as the ``run_subagent`` tool via
  :func:`~lup.subagents.create_run_subagent_tool`, which dispatches a
  one-shot query to the backend serving the spec's model

A spec without a ``model`` inherits the session's main model on every
backend; pinning one (as the specs below do) is a deliberate cost/skill
choice that holds regardless of ``AGENT_SDK``.

Subagents are one of several agent shapes — ``.claude/PATTERNS.md`` is
the full catalog. Where the siblings live:

- Nested agents: a one-shot :func:`lup.adapters.common.query` inside a
  tool handler; the reviewer in ``agent/tools/reflect.py`` is the
  exemplar
- Background agents: ``lup.adapters.background.common``
  (``create_background_agent``), with the observer example in
  ``agent/tools/realtime.py``
- Persistent agents: ``lup.realtime.scheduler`` and ``lup.realtime.relay``,
  with example tools in ``agent/tools/realtime.py``
- Data augmentation: ``agent/tools/example.py`` (domain dispatch,
  null-filling, extraction)
