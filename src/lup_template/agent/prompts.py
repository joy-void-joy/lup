"""The standing prose the agent is told: its task, its guidelines, and how to
deliver a result.

This is a TEMPLATE. Customize for your domain.

This is the agent's brief, not its toolbox. How to use any one tool lives in
that tool's own description, which the agent reads directly — repeating tool
names here would only create a second list to keep in sync (see Tool Design
Philosophy in CLAUDE.md). What stays here is everything no single tool can
say: the job to do, how to approach it, and what a finished result looks like.

The brief is assembled from named sections (:data:`SECTIONS`) so you can add,
drop, or reorder one piece without touching the rest. Two pieces stay correct
on their own: today's date is filled in from a ``{date}`` placeholder, and the
output-format section is generated from :class:`~lup_template.agent.models.AgentOutput`,
so editing that model is what changes the result the agent is asked to submit.
