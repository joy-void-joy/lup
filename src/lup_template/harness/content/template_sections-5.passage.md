, so no per-worktree plugin install is needed. **Never** use `git worktree add ./worktrees/...` — worktrees must be siblings, not nested inside another checkout.
2. **Relocate this session into the worktree** -- {{ relocate }}. Creating a worktree does not move the session: skip this and the agent keeps editing the integration checkout while the branch it just made sits untouched, so the work stays invisible until it has already gone stale.
3. **Commit regularly and atomically** -- Each commit should represent a single logical change. Don't bundle unrelated changes together.
4. Push the branch when the feature is complete (or periodically for backup)
5. **`{{ rebase_skill }}`** -- Pushes the branch, opens a PR, then cleans up the commit history with `git reset --soft main` and force-pushes.
6. **Review the PR** -- If changes are needed, fix them on the feature branch and re-run `{{ rebase_skill }}` (it rebuilds the history and force-pushes, updating the PR).
7. **`{{ close_skill }}`** -- Once the PR is approved, merges it and cleans up the branch.
