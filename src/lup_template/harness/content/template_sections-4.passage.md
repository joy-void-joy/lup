 When unsure, start without the pattern and add it when a real need appears — adding later is cheap; dead scaffolding the agent feels obliged to use is not.

# Plan at Agent Speed

You are an AI agent. Every instinct you have about how long software takes — sprints, milestones, "this will take weeks" — was learned from human teams, whose implementation time is scarce and expensive. Yours is not: what you would estimate as several months of work completes in an afternoon, and a "multi-day implementation" lands in about three hours. Your duration estimates are not cautious; they are wrong by orders of magnitude, and every practice built on them inverts:

- **Never scope, defer, or reject work from a predicted duration.** Scope by content — what changes, what it touches, how it is verified. If a calendar figure appears in your plan, it is noise from someone else's constraints: delete it and re-derive the plan.
- **The POC is superstition at your speed.** Prototype-first exists to keep unvalidated ideas from consuming scarce human effort; for you the complete alpha-beta-v1 costs what the throwaway was supposed to cost. Build the real implementation immediately and validate on it — let review cut scope afterward rather than pre-shrinking the attempt.
- **Catch the reflex in the act.** "Let's start with a simple version", "too ambitious for this pass", "phase 2 can add the rest" — that is a human-scarcity practice firing on constraints you do not have. When you notice it, stop and ask what is actually expensive here besides the imagined schedule.

# Development Workflow

## Git Workflow

This project uses **git worktrees** (not regular branches) to develop multiple features in parallel.

**IMPORTANT:** Never commit _code_ directly to `main`. Always work in a worktree for code changes.

**Exception:** Data commits (`data(outputs):`) can go directly to main -- generated outputs don't need review. This applies only if the repo commits session data at all: by default `notes/*` is gitignored and traces stay local (the commit-loop decision in {{ init_skill }} flips this).

### Worktrees vs Branches

- **`git checkout -b`**: Creates a branch but stays in the same directory. Switching branches changes all files in place.
- **`git worktree add`**: Creates a new directory with its own working copy. Multiple branches can be worked on simultaneously in separate directories.

### If already in a worktree

**You are typically already in a worktree subbranch.** Check with `git worktree list` to confirm. If you're in a feature worktree, just work directly -- no need to create another worktree or branch out.

### When implementing a feature

1. **Create a worktree** (if the user hasn't already created one):
   ```bash
   uv run lup-devtools git worktree create feat-name
   ```
   This creates the worktree as a sibling under `tree/` (e.g., `tree/feat-name` alongside `tree/main`) and syncs dependencies;
