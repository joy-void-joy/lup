## Editing Style

**Prefer small, atomic edits.** A PreToolUse hook counts "real" changed lines (ignoring imports, comments, whitespace, blank lines, docstrings, string literals, type annotations, and TypedDict/BaseModel bodies) and auto-allows edits with <=3 real changes per change block. Pure deletions and single-line `replace_all` renames are auto-allowed; multi-line `replace_all` falls through to the size gate. Anti-pattern detection runs before any auto-allow, and `Write` (full-file rewrites) never auto-allows.

- **Split large changes into multiple small edits** -- keep real (non-trivial) line changes to <=3 per Edit call
- **Separate concerns** -- move imports in one edit, change logic in another (import changes are trivial and don't count)
- **Use `rename-symbol`** for identifier renames instead of `Edit` with `replace_all`
