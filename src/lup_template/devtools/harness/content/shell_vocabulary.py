"""This project's shell auto-allow vocabulary, composed from library groups.

The rule models, :func:`~lup.policy.shell_rules.erase_shell_rules`, and the
groups in :mod:`lup.policy.vocabulary` are library mechanism; what is *this
project's* is the composition below — which groups it takes, what it passes
them, and the one rule no other project has. A downstream project writes its
own composition and never edits lup to change a verdict.

Two judgements here differ from the library's offered defaults, and both are
arguments rather than a fork:

``guard_force_push=False`` — this repository's rebase flow republishes a
branch with ``--force`` every round, so the force is the ordinary case and
guarding it put an approval question on nearly every push. What removes a
remote ref outright stays guarded, because no second push restores it.

``redirect_checkout=True`` — this repository has settled on ``git switch``
and ``git restore``, so ``checkout`` denies and names them instead of asking.

    parsing `pyproject.toml` is how it guarantees a synced environment. The
    conflict workflow is the single place that guarantee cannot be paid for,
    because its commands exist to repair the merge that left the manifest
    unparseable — so those are documented as `.venv/bin/lup-devtools`, and a
    documented invocation the classifier does not resolve is a denial rather
    than a fix. The rows match on the executable's name, which is what a
    console script named by path still presents. Every other subcommand
    bounces back naming the spelling that is admitted, which is what an agent
    reaching past `uv` for no reason should be told.
