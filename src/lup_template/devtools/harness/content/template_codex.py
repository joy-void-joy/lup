**Prefer small, atomic edits.** The PreToolUse hook decodes `apply_patch`'s complete command into before/after documents and applies the canonical edit policy. Safe changes with up to three real added lines are automatically allowed; protected paths, anti-patterns, marker changes, and full-file writes keep their guardrails.

- Split large changes into multiple small patches, one logical change each
- Separate concerns -- move imports in one patch, change logic in another
- Rename identifiers exhaustively and run `uv run pyright` to verify nothing dangles

Nothing type-checks an edit for you here. Codex names the files it changed inside the patch envelope, and decoding one validates its context against the document on disk -- which is already the rewritten version by the time an edit could be observed, so there is no reading of what changed to check. Run `uv run pyright` after every substantive change and act on what it reports.

The `codeintel` tools do answer definitions, usages, and types, resolving imports and aliases as the checker does. Prefer them over word-boundary searches, and confirm a guess against them rather than acting on it. A relative path resolves against the checkout being edited, which the hook publishes on every patch; pass an absolute path when you mean a file somewhere else.

Project Codex configuration is the generated `.codex/config.toml`, loaded only for a trusted project. Personal sandbox and approval defaults belong in `~/.codex/config.toml`; `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` with `approval_policy = "on-request"` is the low-friction guarded default. Never edit the generated project file.

Prefix-safe shell allows from the canonical policy are generated as project-local rules in `.codex/rules/lup.rules`. A matching native `allow` runs outside the sandbox without prompting; the PreToolUse hook remains the semantic gate and blocks unsafe variants. Commands whose safety depends on flags, paths, shell structure, or runtime content stay under the sandbox and approval flow.

# Process & Communication

## Asking Questions

**Ask questions as explicit, numbered options** rather than burying them in prose. This applies to:

- Clarifying requirements or ambiguous instructions
- Offering choices between implementation approaches
- Confirming before destructive or irreversible actions
- Proposing changes or improvements
- Any situation where you need user input before proceeding

Even for open-ended questions, present concrete options plus an explicit free-form alternative, so the user can answer with a single short choice.

**When proposing changes:**

- **Propose, don't assume**: Ask before making changes
- **Show context**: Show relevant current state before proposing
- **Explain rationale**: Every suggestion should include why it would help
- **Offer alternatives**: Present options when multiple valid approaches exist

**When in doubt, ask.** Err on the side of asking questions rather than making assumptions.

## Skills

**After every skill invocation**, reflect on how it was actually used vs. documented:

1. **Compare intent vs usage**: Did the skill serve its documented purpose, or was it adapted?
2. **Notice patterns**: When the user corrects your approach or redirects focus, that's a signal the skill should evolve.
3. **Proactively propose updates**: Suggest skill improvements as explicit options.

**Evolution signals:**

- User provides external docs -> Add doc-fetching or reference to the skill
- User corrects your approach -> Update the skill to prevent future errors
- User asks for something the skill should cover -> Expand scope
- User ignores sections -> Consider simplifying

## External Resources

When questions involve the Claude Agent SDK or the Claude API used by the inner agent, fetch the docs directly:

- `https://docs.claude.com/en/agent-sdk/<topic>`
- `https://docs.claude.com/en/api/<topic>`

When the user provides documentation links, incorporate that knowledge into AGENTS.md or relevant skills.
