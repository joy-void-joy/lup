## Step 0: Parse arguments

The first word is the **command name**. Everything after is a **brief description** of what the command investigates.

If `"""
            ),
            models.ArgumentsRef(),
            models.TextPart(
                text=r"""` is empty, ask the user what the command should be called and what it investigates.

## Step 1: Understand the domain

Before writing anything, understand what this investigator needs to do:

1. **Read existing investigator declarations** as reference:
   - `src/lup_template/devtools/harness/content/skills/debug.py` — traces errors through logs

2. **Explore the codebase** to understand the domain. Based on the description, identify:
   - What specific content will appear in the pasted trace? (tool calls, thinking blocks, error messages, subagent output, etc.)
   - Where are the relevant logs and artifacts on disk? (`logs/`, `notes/`, other directories)
   - What source code is most relevant? Which files in `src/` would the investigator need to read?
   - What devtools commands might be useful? (`uv run lup-devtools --help`)

3. **Use AskUserQuestion** to align on the design:
   - What are the common scenarios this investigator will handle?
   - What are the typical "anchors" in the pasted output that help trace the issue? (IDs, timestamps, function names, error codes, etc.)
   - What domain-specific knowledge should the command encode? (common failure modes, known gotchas, relevant architecture)

## Step 2: Design the command

Based on your exploration and the user's input, design the command. Existing investigator commands share these traits (but adapt to the domain):

**Philosophy**: "Don't hypothesize — trace." The command should guide you to find actual evidence, not speculate.

**Input handling**: The input is **always raw pasted output** via `"""
            ),
            models.ArgumentsRef(),
            models.TextPart(
                text=r"""`. The user pastes trace logs, console output, error messages, or other raw text directly after the command. The command should never expect a file path, session ID, or structured input -- it works from whatever the user pastes. It should explain how to extract anchors (IDs, timestamps, tool names) from the pasted text and how to work with incomplete input.

**Investigation steps**: Domain-specific steps that trace from the pasted input to root cause. Each step should explain:

- What to look for
- Where to look (specific directories, files, scripts)
- What tools/commands to use
- When to ask the user for more context

**Report format**: What happened, why, and how to fix it — adapted to the domain.

**Rules**: Domain-specific rules about what to never do (guess, speculate, etc.) and what to always do (quote evidence, read source, etc.).

## Step 3: Declare the skill

Write the declaration to `src/lup_template/devtools/harness/content/skills/<command_name>.py` as a `models.Skill`, then register it in `content/catalog.py` (import `SKILL as SKILL_<NAME>`, add it to `SKILLS`) and regenerate with `uv run lup-devtools harness claude` and `harness codex`. The command markdown under `.claude/plugins/lup/commands/` is generated from this — never write it by hand.

**Tools**: Choose the `tools` list based on what the investigator needs. Common choices:

- `Read, Grep, Glob` — always needed for code/log exploration
- `Bash(ls:*, wc:*, sort:*, tail:*, stat:*)` — for listing and sizing files
- `Bash(uv run lup-devtools:*)` — if the command needs devtools scripts
- `WebSearch` — if the investigation might need external context
- `AskUserQuestion` — if the investigation might need clarification from the user

**Content**: Write the prompt body as `models.TextPart` parts, splicing `models.ArgumentsRef()` where the pasted output lands. Use the design from Step 2.

## Step 4: Confirm and iterate

Show the user what was created. Offer to refine it — the first draft is rarely perfect. Use AskUserQuestion to check if anything needs adjustment.

## Rules

- **Read before writing** — Always explore the relevant codebase areas before designing the command. The command should reference actual file paths, actual script names, actual log locations.
- **Be specific** — Generic investigation steps ("search the logs") are useless. Point to specific directories, file patterns, scripts, and code locations.
- **Encode domain knowledge** — The whole point of an investigator command is that it captures knowledge you'd otherwise have to rediscover each time. Bake in common failure modes, known gotchas, and relevant architecture.
- **Keep it conversational** — Use AskUserQuestion when you need input. Don't assume.
