**Prefer small, atomic edits.** A PreToolUse hook counts "real" changed lines (ignoring imports, comments, whitespace, blank lines, docstrings, string literals, type annotations, and TypedDict/BaseModel bodies) and auto-allows edits with <=3 real changes per change block. Pure deletions and single-line `replace_all` renames are auto-allowed; multi-line `replace_all` falls through to the size gate. Anti-pattern detection runs before any auto-allow, and `Write` (full-file rewrites) never auto-allows.

- **Split large changes into multiple small edits** -- keep real (non-trivial) line changes to <=3 per Edit call
- **Separate concerns** -- move imports in one edit, change logic in another (import changes are trivial and don't count)
- **Use `rename-symbol`** for identifier renames instead of `Edit` with `replace_all`

        *DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_THROUGH_TOOLS,
        models.TextPart(
            text=r"""## Diagnostics after an edit

Every edit is type-checked, by the hook rather than by an editor's language server. The checker runs in the checkout that holds the file you edited, so its answer is about the copy you changed. Findings for that file arrive as a hook error naming the line; nothing arrives when it checks out clean.

That rooting is the point. A language server the runtime starts is rooted once, where the session opened, and keeps that root after work moves to a worktree -- so it resolves the same module names against the launch checkout and reports, with no sign anything is wrong, about a file nobody edited. Anything a session-wide language server tells you about a file in a worktree is worth confirming against this.

The `codeintel` tools answer navigation questions the same way, per question rather than per session. **Use them actively** -- they resolve imports and aliases, which grep cannot.

**Navigation (use before editing unfamiliar code):**

- **find_definition** -- Where a symbol is defined. Use instead of grepping for `def foo` or `class Foo`.
- **find_references** -- Every use of a symbol. Use instead of grepping for a name.
- **hover** -- The inferred type and documentation at a position.
- **list_symbols** -- Every symbol a file declares. Use instead of grepping for `def ` or `class `.

**Refactoring:**

- **rename_symbol** -- Plan a workspace-wide rename. **Always prefer this over `Edit` with `replace_all`** for identifier renames -- it understands scope and won't rename unrelated identifiers. It reports the edits; you apply them.

A relative path resolves against the checkout being edited, which the same hook publishes. Pass an absolute path when you mean a file somewhere else.

**When to use LSP vs grep/Edit:**

| Task                             | Use LSP            | Use grep/Edit    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Find where a function is defined | `go-to-definition` |                  |
| Find all callers of a function   | `find-references`  |                  |
| Rename a variable/function/class | `rename-symbol`    |                  |
| Search for a string literal      |                    | `Bash` + `grep`  |
| Search across non-Python files   |                    | `Bash` + `grep`  |
| Change logic within a function   |                    | `Edit`           |
| Add new code                     |                    | `Edit` / `Write` |

# Process & Communication

## Asking Questions

**Always use the `AskUserQuestion` tool** instead of asking questions in plain text. This applies to:

- Clarifying requirements or ambiguous instructions
- Offering choices between implementation approaches
- Confirming before destructive or irreversible actions
- Proposing changes or improvements
- Any situation where you need user input before proceeding

Even for open-ended questions, use `AskUserQuestion` with options that include a custom input option. This allows structured notification parsing.

**When proposing changes:**

- **Propose, don't assume**: Use AskUserQuestion before making changes
- **Show context**: Show relevant current state before proposing
- **Explain rationale**: Every suggestion should include why it would help
- **Offer alternatives**: Present options when multiple valid approaches exist

**When in doubt, ask.** Err on the side of asking questions rather than making assumptions.

## Slash Commands & Skills

**After every command invocation**, reflect on how it was actually used vs. documented:

1. **Compare intent vs usage**: Did the command serve its documented purpose, or was it adapted?
2. **Notice patterns**: When the user corrects your approach or redirects focus, that's a signal the command should evolve.
3. **Proactively propose updates**: Use AskUserQuestion to suggest command improvements.

**Evolution signals:**

- User provides external docs -> Add doc-fetching or reference to command
- User corrects your approach -> Update command to prevent future errors
- User asks for something the command should cover -> Expand scope
- User ignores sections -> Consider simplifying

## External Resources

When questions involve Claude Code, Agent SDK, or Claude API:

1. **Use the claude-code-guide subagent**:

   ```
   Agent(subagent_type="claude-code-guide", prompt="<specific question>")
   ```

2. **Fetch docs directly** for specific pages:
   - `WebFetch(url="https://docs.claude.com/en/agent-sdk/<topic>")`
   - `WebFetch(url="https://docs.claude.com/en/claude-code/<topic>")`

When the user provides documentation links, incorporate that knowledge into CLAUDE.md or relevant commands.
