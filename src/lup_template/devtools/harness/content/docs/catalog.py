"""Every document this repository publishes under ``docs/``.

The pages about lup's own machinery come from the library; declared here are
the two whose subject is this repository — what the template half is, and the
decisions behind its development tooling — plus the index that lists both.
Generation turns the roster into artifacts, so a document that is not
declared here does not exist and a file under ``docs/`` that is not produced
from here is deleted as unowned. Nothing beneath ``docs/`` is hand-written.
