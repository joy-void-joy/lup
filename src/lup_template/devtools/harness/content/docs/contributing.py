This page is for a contributor arriving cold. It covers getting a working
checkout, deciding where a change belongs, and what has to be green before it
lands. The component guides — [library.md](library.md),
[template.md](template.md), [harness.md](harness.md) — cover *how* to make a
change once you know where it goes.

## Getting set up

```bash
uv sync                                    # both workspace packages
uv run lup-devtools setup                  # interactive: keys, integrations
uv run lup-devtools dev check              # the local pre-flight bar
```

`uv` is the package manager: use `uv add <package>`, never edit
`pyproject.toml` by hand. Secrets go in `.env.local`, which is gitignored;
`.env` holds template defaults. `uv run lup-devtools --help` is the full
command tree.

To launch the repository as a native agent plugin:

```bash
uv run lup-devtools harness claude          # generate, then launch
uv run lup-devtools harness codex
```

## Where does my change go?

| If you are changing… | It belongs in | And you should read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anything another project built on lup would want | `packages/lup/` | [library.md](library.md) |
| Anything only this application needs | `src/lup_template/` | [template.md](template.md) |
| A skill, agent, guidance, permission policy, or a page under `docs/` | `src/lup_template/devtools/harness/content/` | [harness.md](harness.md) |
| Repeated shell incantations | a new `lup-devtools` command | [template.md](template.md) |
| A one-off computation | `lup-devtools py eval`, or a new command | below |

The placement question between the first two rows is the one that matters, and
it has a single test: *would another project built on lup want this?* If yes,
it goes in the library even if only this application uses it today. The
library never imports the application, so a utility placed wrongly in
`src/lup_template/` is unreachable from `packages/lup/` and will have to move
later.

`tmp/` is scratch: gitignored, so nothing written there reaches a diff, a
reviewer, or a human — which is why it does not execute. One-off work takes
the first of these that fits:

1. `uv run lup-devtools py eval '<expression>'`, which auto-imports and needs
   no file, for anything expressible as one expression.
2. The sandbox, where the work allows it.
3. A new `lup-devtools` command — reviewable, because `devtools/` lands in
   the diff.
4. As a last resort, an inline heredoc behind an escalation marker
   ([permissions.md](permissions.md)).

The argument is reviewability, not power: an agent may already edit
`devtools/` and run it.

Never create a tracking file. A `TODO.md`, backlog, or roadmap parks a
decision where no workflow surfaces it again. Deferred work lives as a
`# lup: defer: <text>` note at the site it concerns — where `dev comments`
lists it in its own parked section and `dev check` keeps it visible until
somebody wakes it — or as a question to the user. That bare spelling is the
default: nothing evaluates a wake condition mechanically, so a bracketed
`defer[<gate>]: <text>` is for a real, externally-checkable gate ("until the
v2 API ships"), never for restating that this code might change again.

## Git workflow

Development happens in **worktrees**, not branches switched in place, so
several changes can be in flight at once:

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev worktree create feat-name
```

The worktree is created as a sibling under `tree/`. Never nest one inside
another checkout. `git checkout -b` would make a branch and switch the
current directory in place; `git worktree add` gives the branch a directory
of its own, which is what keeps several live at once. `worktrees/` and
`refs/` are gitignored, the latter holding symlinks to downstream projects.

Commit early, commit often, and keep commits atomic — if the message needs an
"and", it is two commits. The format is `type(scope): description`:

| Type | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | New feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance — dependencies, build config |
| `meta` | Harness content and the trees it generates: guidance, settings, skills, hooks |
| `data` | Generated data and outputs |

A `data` commit of generated outputs may go straight to `dev`; code never
does. Session data under `notes/` is gitignored here, so such commits arise
only in a repository that opted into the commit-loop pattern at init.

Two branches: `dev` is the integration branch feature work merges into, and
`main` is stable and receives only reviewed pull requests from `dev`. Never
commit code directly to `dev`.

resolution — and during a merge the bias is toward inclusion: audit the result
against both parents and confirm every removed function, parameter, or command
was removed deliberately rather than lost to a conflict side.

Generated artifacts are regenerated, never hand-merged. A digest manifest
(`.lup-ownership.json`) conflicts on every parallel branch because each field
is derived, so `.gitattributes` gives it a driver that keeps one side, and
`lup-devtools dev merge-driver` registers that driver in a clone that has not
run `worktree create`. Reconciling such a file hunk by hunk produces a proof
matching neither tree: take either side, run
`lup-devtools harness generate all`, and let `harness check all` confirm it
settled.

## What has to be green

```bash
uv run ruff format . && uv run ruff check . && uv run pyright && uv run pytest
uv run lup-devtools dev check              # markers, anti-patterns, boundaries
uv run lup-devtools harness check all      # generated-tree drift
uv run lup-devtools dev rules --check      # the generated rule reference
```

[quality-pipeline.md](quality-pipeline.md) explains which of the three
automated layers catches what, and why commit-time regeneration is
path-scoped. The short version: the per-push CI workflow is the gate that
binds, the pre-commit hook only stops harness-relevant commits from landing
without their regenerated output, and the nightly lane owns everything that
needs a real native CLI.

Two conventions catch most first-time review comments:

- **Every function specifies input and output types**, and `Any`,
  `dict[str, Any]`, and `dict[str, object]` are not among them. Use a
  `TypedDict`, a Pydantic model, or `JsonValue`/`JsonObject` from `lup.types`
  for data whose schema lives elsewhere. `# type: ignore` is forbidden; the
  audited `# lup: ignore[rule-id]` escape hatch exists for genuine boundaries.
- **Errors are never silently swallowed.** No `except: pass`, no
  `contextlib.suppress`. Log with `logger.exception()`, handle it, or re-raise.

[rules.md](rules.md) indexes every executable rule with its matching shape and
the module that enforces it. A denial names its rule id, so you rarely need to
read it first.

### The `# lup: ignore` escape hatch

When `Any` or another anti-pattern is genuinely needed — an untyped library
boundary, MCP — an inline ignore requests user approval rather than silencing
the check on its own authority.

Prefer the typed, pyright-style `# lup: ignore[rule-id]`, comma-separating a
list (`# lup: ignore[dict-get, tuple-shape]`), so a site silences exactly the
rule it needs and still trips the others. The bare `# lup: ignore` stays
valid, but the auditor flags it as untyped to nudge migration. The marker must
sit on the line that trips the rule: one line above is reported as spurious
while the violation stays uncovered.

In a file's first 10 lines the marker goes file-wide — a standalone
`# lup: ignore` disables anti-pattern checks for the whole file, and
`# lup: ignore[rule-id]` disables only that rule, the way `# pyright: ignore`
works for files.

## Tests

One standard decides whether a test earns its place: **would it catch a
realistic regression?** A test that asserts a fixture back at itself, or that
pins language behavior rather than library behavior, is deleted rather than
maintained.

Two lanes. `tests/unit/` is deterministic, runs on every push, and pins
adopter-visible behavior: security decisions, byte determinism, wire formats,
state persistence. `tests/integration/` carries the `integration` marker, is
deselected by default, and runs against real installed native CLIs and Docker
on the nightly lane — that is where anything requiring a live boundary
belongs, and nothing in the unit lane may infer it.

The strongest fixtures in the repository are the shared policy cases in
`test_semantic_policy.py`: every case runs against both the canonical policy
objects and the assembled hermetic runtime under `python3 -I -S`, so the
dependency-free generated kernel cannot drift from the library. When you touch
`lup.policy`, that suite is the one to run first.

Behavior that must not regress silently is pinned rather than described:
`test_harness_compilation.py` holds byte-deterministic regeneration and the
live tree drift-clean, `test_rule_reference.py` fails when
[rules.md](rules.md) goes stale, and `test_capability_matrix_docs.py` does the
same for the capability matrix.

## Reviewing a change

A change to canonical harness source arrives with its regenerated artifacts,
and both halves are reviewed together. What to look for:

- A prompt change should be understandable from its content module alone.
- A policy-data change should trace to the `HookSet` or a canonical rule
  object — and `hooks/runtime/kernel.py` should be byte-identical to the
  canonical kernel, with configuration confined to `policy_data.py`.
- Both native trees change when a portable declaration does; only the owning
  tree changes for an adapter-private renderer change.
- `.lup-ownership.json` is generated proof, not hand-authored metadata.
- A conflict is never resolved by deleting an unknown file. Classify its
  ownership or leave the conflict explicit.
- No credentials, plugin trust, installed cache contents, active sessions, or
  local profile configuration are ever committed.

Unresolved `# lup:` review notes stay visible in a full local `dev check`.
They are feedback to act on, not lint to clear: a note comes out when the code
or structure it points at has actually changed. """

        models.SkillInvocation(plugin="lup", skill="resolve"),
        models.TextPart(

[resolver.md](resolver.md) describes what it does.

## Native evidence and the release gate

Deterministic fixtures run on every change. A scheduled workflow additionally
runs the full integration marker against installed Claude and Codex binaries,
covering the session-id, pager, dynamic-tool-schema, and blocked-edit
boundaries that only a real CLI can prove. `harness doctor` compares installed
versions against the typed evidence ledger; a newer component warns locally
and fails the nightly strict check, while the live job still runs so drift
cannot suppress the evidence needed to review it.

Beyond the ordinary pull-request checks, cutting a release requires two
consecutive scheduled nightly runs in which:

- the credentials-gated native job **completed successfully** — a skipped job
  is not a green run, and a completed failure stays release-blocking;
- the strict evidence job reported no drift between the installed native
  versions and [native-capabilities.md](native-capabilities.md).

Review the probe output together with the evidence ledger rather than updating
the ledger mechanically.
