# lup: ignore[constant-declaration]
# Every constant here is this repository's own composition — which runtimes it
# builds for, and what it calls its own harness session. A composition root is
# where a judgement is finally made rather than passed on, so there is no
# caller above it to take these from.
"""Root of the project-owned harness declaration graph.

The declaration leaves — skills, agents, prompt documents, settings, and
assets — live under ``content/``, aggregated by ``content.catalog``. This
module assembles those leaves with the hook policy and the resolver spec
into the portable ``Harness`` that ``generate`` compiles into both native
trees. Generated guidance and the adopter docs point here as the file that
owns URL scopes, protected edit roots, and the shell vocabulary declared in
``content.shell_vocabulary``, so its path is part of the documented surface.
