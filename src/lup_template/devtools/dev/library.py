"""How this project obtains the ``lup`` library.

A project built on this template reaches ``lup`` one of four ways, and the
mode is a property of ``pyproject.toml`` that can be changed at any time:

``published``
    The release from PyPI. Upgrading is ``uv lock --upgrade-package lup``
    plus a harness regeneration, rather than a merge against a vendored fork.
``git``
    The repository itself, resolved at a branch, tag, or commit. The default
    for a new project while no release is published: it gives an adopter the
    same package a release would, from the only place the library exists yet,
    so nothing has to be vendored to get it.
``local``
    A copy under ``packages/lup``, wired as a uv workspace member. What the
    template ships, and what a project that genuinely needs to modify library
    source keeps.
``linked``
    An editable install of a lup checkout elsewhere on disk. Library changes
    made while working on this project land in lup's own repository, which is
    how an improvement discovered downstream reaches the library.

Leaving ``local`` also strips the workspace wiring that stops resolving once
``packages/lup`` is gone: the uv workspace, the pytest source path, and the
pyright includes and execution environments rooted in the package.

Reading is a ``tomllib`` parse matched structurally; writing goes through
``tomlkit`` so comments and layout survive the edit.

Examples::

    $ uv run lup-devtools dev library status
    $ uv run lup-devtools dev library use published --version 0.3.0
    $ uv run lup-devtools dev library git --branch dev
    $ uv run lup-devtools dev library link ../lup.git/tree/dev
