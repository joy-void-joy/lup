"""Scan tracked files for inline markers.

Backs two `lup-devtools dev` commands (wired in
`lup_template.devtools.dev.app`):

- `dev comments` lists unresolved `# lup:` / `// lup:` feedback notes, with
  deferred (`defer:`) notes in their own section;
  `report`, `commit_prompts`, and `clear_markers` back its default listing
  and its `--commit` / `--clear` modes.
- `dev todos` lists `TEMPLATE:` customization markers — the template's
  domain decision points that `/lup:init` walks one by one.

Examples::

    $ uv run lup-devtools dev comments
    $ uv run lup-devtools dev comments --json
    $ uv run lup-devtools dev comments --commit
    $ uv run lup-devtools dev comments --clear path/to/file.py:42
    $ uv run lup-devtools dev todos --json
