"""Ask this project's permission policy what it thinks, without running it.

Tuning a vocabulary you cannot query is guesswork. Before this, finding out
whether a command asks meant adding a fixture to the semantic-policy suite and
running the file — so nobody swept the everyday commands, and each one earned
its allowance only after annoying somebody enough to be reported. The same
question is also what an agent wants at the moment it is stopped, where the
reason string alone leaves it guessing which clause it tripped.

The policy read here is the declared one — the same ``HookSet`` both generated
plugins are compiled from — so an answer here is the answer a session gets.
