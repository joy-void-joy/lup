"""Example MCP tools showing the pattern.

This is a TEMPLATE. Create your own tools following this pattern.

Key patterns:
1. Use @lup_tool(description, InputModel, OutputModel) decorator
2. Define input/output schemas as BaseModel with Field(description=...)
3. Handler receives a validated model instance (not a raw dict)
4. Handler must return a BaseModel instance (auto-serialized to MCP response)
5. Tool name defaults to the function name; override with name="..."
6. Metrics (duration, errors) are tracked automatically

Tool descriptions are the agent's only documentation for each tool.
A terse description forces the agent to guess when/why to use a tool,
which leads to misuse or underuse. A good description answers:
  - WHAT: What does this tool do? (concrete behavior)
  - WHEN: When should the agent use it? (triggers, conditions)
  - WHY: Why does this tool exist? (what problem it solves)
This keeps tool knowledge in the tool itself rather than in the prompt,
so descriptions stay accurate as tools are added or changed.
