"""Environment harness for running the agent.

This package contains the domain-specific scaffolding:
- User interaction and I/O
- Game logic or application flow
- External system integration
- Session lifecycle management

The feedback loop focuses on improving lup.agent, not this code.
However, this code evolves as the application requirements change.

- client.py: Entry point for running agent sessions
