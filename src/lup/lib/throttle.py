"""Rate limiting combining concurrency control and temporal spacing.

Provides a generic Throttle class that enforces both a maximum number of
concurrent requests (semaphore) and a minimum time interval between request
starts. This prevents API rate limit violations during concurrent agent
sessions in batch mode.

Throttle instances are designed as module-level singletons, configured from
settings, and shared across all concurrent sessions in the process.

Example:
    from lup.lib.throttle import Throttle

    # Pure concurrency limiting
    api_throttle = Throttle(max_concurrent=3)

    # Concurrency + temporal spacing
    rate_limited = Throttle(max_concurrent=1, min_interval=2.0)

    async def call_api():
        async with rate_limited:
            return await do_request()
