"""Behavior tests for the marker scanner (`lup.codescan.markers`).

Pins the load-bearing rule that distinguishes a real note from code: in
Python a `# lup:` counts only inside a comment or docstring, never inside
an ordinary string literal. The scanner's own "no notes" echo strings are the
canonical false positive that line-scanning used to report. The same scan,
parameterized over the marker regex, backs the `TEMPLATE:` customization
todos that `dev todos` gathers for `/lup:init`.
