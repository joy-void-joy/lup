"""Where editing is happening, published by one process and read by another.

The writer is the hermetic hook runtime, which may not import the module that
owns the record. Nothing passes between them: each resolves the location out
of the repository they are both in, and each spells the record's shape for
itself — so these pin both ends against each other, since no type checker
spans that boundary.
