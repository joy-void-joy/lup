"""A shell rule's axes cascade, and spelling one out changes no verdict.

Absence means one thing everywhere in the table: inherit from the level above,
never the most permissive value. That is what lets a placement wanted for a
whole command be stated once instead of repeated per subcommand, and what
makes a command's effect constrain the subcommands it has not judged.

Reading absence that way is only safe where a table states every judgement it
means rather than leaving one to a default, so the offered vocabulary spells
its effects out: `git branch` says `allow` beneath a deny-default `git` rather
than leaning on the omission to say it. The last test here is the one that
matters — the only forms escaping the sandbox are the git forms that reach a
verdict, because `git` declares its placement at the command its verbs share.
