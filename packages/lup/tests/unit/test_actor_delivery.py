"""Delivering what a door said to an actor, exactly once and never never.

The defect these are written against reported success and delivered
nothing: every reader of the message stream started at whatever its head
was when the reader was constructed, so a message posted while a turn was
in flight was already behind the window the next turn opened. It was not
delivered late. It was delivered to nobody, in any round, while the console
printed `redirected worker:research-corpus-retrieval#1`.
