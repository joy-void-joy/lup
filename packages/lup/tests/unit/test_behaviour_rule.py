"""Project-indexed model-free-function rule tests.

The rule is a proxy for a judgement it cannot make — whether behaviour belongs
on the model — so what has to be pinned is the shape it stands in for, and
each narrowing that keeps it from firing where no method could go. A defect in
the shape degrades silently toward *fewer* findings rather than failing, which
is why the exclusions are named here one by one rather than left to a single
"clean file" assertion.
