"""Codex's half of the compiled hook dispatcher.

:mod:`lup.policy.dispatcher` compiles this module together with the shared
host half into the plugin's `hooks/scripts/policy.py`, so this is not itself
a script. It holds only what Codex spells for itself: the environment naming
the home it installs trusted packages beneath, relativization against the
worktree rather than the launch directory, the tools it routes, the patch
envelope it decodes into per-file edits, and the fail-closed exit it takes
where the command-hook boundary offers no way to ask.

A call none of those three decode is put to the refusal table before it earns
the unclassified ask, so this file never names a tool it has no semantics for.
Which names a runtime offers is that runtime's own fact; which of them a
project has decided against is the application's — so the tools a refusal adds
to the routed set come from the declaration rather than from a list here.

The imports below resolve against the generated runtime the compiled script
sits beside, which is why this file is type-checked against that tree rather
than against the workspace.

    one validates its context against the document on disk — which this

    fail on exactly the edits it was called for. Codex hands over its
    working directory instead, which Claude's hook is promised nothing
    about, and that is the same fact one step coarser.

    Coarser is enough to say which checkout is being edited and not enough
    to type-check what changed, so Codex records the edition and Claude also
    reports diagnostics. Checking the directory instead would answer every
    patch with every finding in the tree, most of them about files this
