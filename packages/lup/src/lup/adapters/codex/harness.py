    Codex prefix rules approve commands but do not choose sandbox placement.
    Because the same rule also approves a caller-requested escape, only forms
    placed ``outside`` can be widened into a native allow; ambient forms stay
    inside, and one placed ``inside`` is never approved for an escape. The runtime
    hook continues to classify those forms, along with
    every command whose safety depends on parsed content.

    The erased rows are what this reads rather than the declarations they came
    from, because the rows are where both axes have been resolved down the
    nesting: a level that inherited its effect is native-allowed on exactly the
    terms of one that spelled it out, which is the same reading the dispatcher
    and the canonical policy take.

    The prefix is the approval half of an escape the caller requests with
    ``sandbox_permissions=require_escalated``. A runner target declared
    ``outside`` receives that approval; an ambient target does not. The escape
    itself is chosen on the model's own call rather than compiled
    in advance — :meth:`CodexSpellings.escape_sandbox` carries it. The forms
    this cannot widen — a target behind a global flag, or one joined into a
    compound command — reach the hook, where a confined session is stopped
