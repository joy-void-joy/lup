"""Claude Code's configuration document, and a private one per workspace.

Where that document sits is Claude's own rule rather than a shape any
portable contract carries: with ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` set it is
``.config.json`` inside the named directory, and with the variable unset it
is ``~/.claude.json`` beside the home instead of in it. Both answers matter,
because a session whose document was derived from the wrong one starts
holding no record of the projects it is trusted in — which is the same
degraded state as having no document at all.

Trust is recorded here too, and only for a workspace lup itself created.
Invoking a run against a repository is an explicit act of trust by whoever
ran it; lup extends exactly that to the checkouts it makes of that same
repository, and to nothing else it happens to open a session in.
