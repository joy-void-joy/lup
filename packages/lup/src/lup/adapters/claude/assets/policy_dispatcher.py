"""Claude Code's half of the compiled hook dispatcher.

:mod:`lup.policy.dispatcher` compiles this module together with the shared
host half into the plugin's `hooks/scripts/policy.py`, so this is not itself
a script. It holds only what Claude Code spells for itself: the environment
naming the root it installs trusted packages beneath, relativization against
the launch directory, the four tools it routes, and the conservative ask it
returns through its own decision channel for input nothing can decide from.

The imports below resolve against the generated runtime the compiled script
sits beside, which is why this file is type-checked against that tree rather
than against the workspace.
