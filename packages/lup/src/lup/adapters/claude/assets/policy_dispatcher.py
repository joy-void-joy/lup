"""Claude Code's half of the compiled hook dispatcher.

:mod:`lup.policy.dispatcher` compiles this module together with the shared
host half into the plugin's `hooks/scripts/policy.py`, so this is not itself
a script. It holds only what Claude Code spells for itself: the environment
naming the root it installs trusted packages beneath, relativization against
the launch directory, the tools it routes, and the conservative ask it
returns through its own decision channel for input nothing can decide from.

A call none of those four decode is put to the refusal table before it earns
the unclassified ask, so this file never names a tool it has no semantics for.
Which names a runtime offers is that runtime's own fact; which of them a
project has decided against is the application's — so the tools a refusal adds
to the routed set come from the declaration rather than from a list here.

The imports below resolve against the generated runtime the compiled script
sits beside, which is why this file is type-checked against that tree rather
than against the workspace.

def rendered(decision, payload, placed):
    """Answer one call on the permission channel, and place it on the other.

    Claude Code takes a call's sandbox as an argument of the call rather than
    as part of the verdict, so a placed decision goes out as the permission
    decision plus a rewrite of the arguments — which is what makes an
    unprompted placement reachable at all. Three things in the runtime make
    that rewrite carry the flag rather than swallow it, each read out of the
    shipped Claude Code binary at version 2.1.228 — the baseline to re-check
    against, rather than a conclusion to remember: the PreToolUse hook
    schema types `updatedInput` as an open record of arbitrary keys;
    `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` is a declared field of the shell tool's own
    input schema, so it is not an unknown key for the schema validation a
    returned `updatedInput` has to pass; and the one per-tool key filter
    applied to it before execution is keyed by a table naming a different
    tool, so for the shell tool the object arrives whole and the sandbox is
    chosen from it. What remains outside this file's reach is the session
    itself: a host that forbids unsandboxed commands ignores the flag, and
    the call runs confined with the verdict unchanged.

    The rewrite replaces the arguments rather than merging into them, so the
    whole input is carried through. A deferral is placed nowhere, which is
    also why nothing here reads a payload a deferral may not have parsed.

    ``placed`` carries the other rewrite this channel can hand back: the same
    edit with its suppression directives at their canonical placement. It
    rides along with the verdict rather than replacing it — placing a
    directive settles where it is written and says nothing about whether the
    edit may happen, so an ask still asks, over the placed text, which is what
    the approver should be reading. A denied call runs nothing, so there is
    nothing to place. The two rewrites never contend for the one
    ``updatedInput`` field: a directive is placed only in an ``Edit`` or
    ``Write``, and the sandbox argument belongs only to ``Bash``.

    Both sandbox questions are answered yes here, from that one field: the
    rewrite is how a verdict places a call, and the same field on the call the
    agent writes is how the agent places its own — which is what an
    ``escalable`` verdict offers it. Both halves of that offer are decided in
    the kernel rather than spelled here: `escalation_offer` says whether it is
    extended, and `sandbox_escaped` whether a call that spent it still leaves.
    The in-process seam asks the same two, because one field two boundaries
    fill from two conditions is a field they can fill differently — which is
    how the rewrite once revoked an offer the permission channel had granted.
