"""Persistent Python REPL server — runs inside the Docker container.

Protocol (JSON-line over stdin/stdout):
  Request:  ``{"code": "...", "timeout": 30}``
  Response: ``{"exit_code": 0, "stdout": "...", "stderr": "...",
             "result": "42", "duration_ms": 42}``

- All exec() calls share a single namespace, so variables and imports
  persist across requests (like notebook cells).
- A cell ending in an expression reports that expression's ``repr`` as
  ``result`` and binds it to ``_``, the way an interactive REPL echoes.
  Cells ending in a statement, and expressions evaluating to None, report
  a null result.
- sys.stdin/stdout/stderr are redirected to /dev/null so user code cannot
  interfere with the JSON protocol; the original streams stay bound to
  protocol I/O inside :func:`serve`. User code cannot reach the server's
  own state either — it executes with the shared namespace as its globals,
  and ``serve``'s locals are invisible to it.
- SIGALRM enforces per-request timeouts (exit_code 124 on expiry).
- stdout/stderr are capped at 1 MB to prevent memory blowouts.

Pure stdlib, and it only runs as ``__main__``: the sandbox copies this file
into the container and launches ``python -u`` on it, while ``lup.sandbox.repl``
merely ships its source text — importing it host-side starts nothing.
