    An injected engine with no consumer-facing surface. It reaches consumers

    turn inside its own concern — ``send_interruptible`` around signal
    handling, ``run_relay_session`` around a mailbox. Those two share only
    start-then-result, which ``Client.query`` already homes for
    callers that want it, so there is no further shared behaviour for a
    composing surface to hold.

    Both drivers do hold a ``SessionHandle`` and narrow to ``.session`` on
    purpose. Taking the handle instead would fold them under the transparent
    carrier above and retire this paragraph, but a driver that only starts
    turns should not also demand ``fork``; the narrow parameter is the reason
    this exemption exists rather than an oversight that created it.
