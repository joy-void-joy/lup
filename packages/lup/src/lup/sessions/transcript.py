"""Deriving a transcript from the events that are the record.

Events are canonical and the transcript is derived, rather than both being
accumulated side by side. Two accumulators can disagree — and did: a watcher
saw a tool call and never its result, because tool results reached the
message list and never the event stream. A stream that omits half of what
happened cannot serve as a trace, whatever else it is good for.

One fold, used by every adapter, is what keeps that from happening again.
