"""Keeping oversized tool results from reaching the provider's truncation.

A provider truncates an MCP tool result past a few hundred thousand
characters and writes the overflow to a file. An agent reads that file, which
is also too large, and is handed the same redirect again — the loop costs a
context window and produces nothing. The fix is to never let the oversized
value reach the wire: :func:`spill_oversized_result` writes each large string
field to disk and leaves a pointer in its place, so what the agent receives is
a path and a preview it can page through.

Sizes here are defaults rather than constants. What counts as oversized is a
judgement about a provider's limit and how much of the window a caller is
willing to spend, so :func:`configure` takes each one.
