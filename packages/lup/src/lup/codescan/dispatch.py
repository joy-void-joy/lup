"""Project-wide AST enforcement against dispatching on our own model types.

A union we declare answers questions through its members: the base names the
operation and each variant answers or declines it, so a new variant is one
class instead of an edit to every walk that would have to notice it. Branching
on the variant's *type* instead — `isinstance`, a `case ClassName()` arm, an
`assert_never` net — moves that knowledge out into the walks, where a filter
goes stale by omission the moment a variant is added.

Narrowing untyped data is the opposite case and stays legitimate: a vendor
payload, a `JsonValue`, an `ast` node are alternatives that are not ours to
give a method to. A line regex cannot tell the two apart, because they are the
same characters — the difference is only in what the named type *resolves to*.
This rule resolves it, through the project-wide class index in
:mod:`lup.codescan.project`: it fires only when the matched type is a class
this repository defines that inherits `pydantic.BaseModel`, and stays silent
on every builtin, standard-library, and vendor type.
