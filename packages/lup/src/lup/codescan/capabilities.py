# lup: ignore[set-shape, empty-collection, string-split]
# Graph sets over the shared symbol index are this AST rule's domain, and

"""Project-wide AST enforcement for Lup capability ABC composition.

Audits every resolved project import for the ``abc-capability`` shape
described in ``docs/architecture.md``: one narrow capability per ABC, no
concrete behavior, no multiple inheritance. The ``lup-devtools dev check
--antipatterns`` auditor runs :func:`audit_capabilities` across the tree; the
anti-pattern registry re-exports the rule id so deny messages name it.

The tree reading, name resolution, and suppression grammar this rule works
from live in :mod:`lup.codescan.project`, which it shares with
:mod:`lup.codescan.dispatch`.
