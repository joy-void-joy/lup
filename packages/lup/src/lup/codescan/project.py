# lup: ignore[dict-str-payload, set-shape, empty-collection, string-split]
# Symbol tables, graph sets, and qualified-name resolution are this engine's domain.
"""Typed AST engine shared by every project-wide Lup rule.

A line regex sees characters; the rules that need to tell one construct from a
look-alike need names. This module reads the tree once and answers the two
questions those rules ask: *what does this name resolve to* — through imports,
aliases, and relative packages, into a project-wide class index — and *is this
site suppressed*, through the same `# lup: ignore` grammar the line scanners
use.

`lup.codescan.capabilities` and `lup.codescan.dispatch` are its customers.
Both hand it :class:`PythonSource` values, read :func:`build_symbol_index` for
resolved class shapes, and hand their mechanical violations back to
:func:`audit_suppressions`, which classifies each one as covered, missing,
bare, or guarding nothing at all.
