# lup: ignore[native-spelling]
# This checker necessarily owns the provider spellings it audits.
"""AST boundary rules keeping the library reusable by someone else's project.

Two directions are guarded. *Inward*: named adapter packages, tests, and
explicit application/CLI composition roots may import concrete implementations
and spell provider wire names, while every other module composes only the
portable contracts. *Outward*: a library module may not decide for its
adopters — a declared data table has to be reachable as an overridable
default, so an adopter replaces the vocabulary rather than editing the library
(``library-default``, the mechanical half of the placement criterion in
``docs/library.md``).

The same criterion holds beyond the library, where the choice is frozen for
this project's own callers rather than for an adopter, so ``constant-declaration``
judges every other module-level constant by it. The two read one enumeration
and :meth:`ConstantDeclaration.judging_rule` hands each declaration to exactly
one of them, so neither can reach a line the other owns.

A deliberate exception uses the typed ``# lup: ignore[<rule-id>]`` on the
offending line or as a file-level directive, with a reason.
