# lup: ignore[empty-collection, import-re, re-call, set-shape]
"""Single importable source of truth for the codebase's anti-pattern set.

The generated hermetic edit policy denies an edit whose added lines match one
of these patterns unless the line carries a `# lup: ignore`. Harness generation
projects these rows into its dependency-free runtime; a test asserts that
projection stays identical, and the `lup-devtools dev check --antipatterns`
auditor consumes them to scan the whole tree after the fact (catching lines that slipped in past the hook and
`# lup: ignore` markers that no longer guard anything).

Each rule carries a stable kebab-case ``id``. A directive names rules
pyright-style — `# lup: ignore[dict-get]` silences only ``dict-get`` on that
line, `# lup: ignore[a, b]` a list — so one open site opts out of one rule
without blinding the others. The bare `# lup: ignore` stays valid (it silences
every rule) but the auditor surfaces it as "untyped" so the migration to typed
directives is gradual.

The set is a syntax-aware linter pass, not a raw grep: every rule declares the
syntactic ``context`` it inspects, and Python source is tokenized once (via
`lup.codescan.common.LineProjections`) so "code" rules scan lines with string
literals and comments blanked while "comment" directive rules see comments
intact. The detectors themselves stay regexes because that is the primitive
form the hermetic hook runtime can carry (ruff has no plugin API, and engines
that do — flake8, pylint, semgrep — could not run inside the hook).

Refiners sharpen individual rules on top of that floor, and what a refiner
needs decides who can run it. `refined_exempt_lines` reads the AST alone, so
the hook applies it too and both gates judge a line the same way — a broad
regex the kernel keeps flagging while the audit calls its marker spurious is
a change one gate demands and the other refuses. `lup.codescan.grammar` goes
further and resolves what a matched receiver is declared on, so `dict-get` can
distinguish a mapping from an HTTP client; that needs a type oracle and stays
audit-side. Both return `Refutation` rows this module drops — and reports the
surviving directives for. Regex alone remains where a rule is text-shaped. The
`lup.codescan.registry` index and the generated `docs/rules.md` reference list
this family beside the boundary, spelling, and architecture rules.

Most messages read the same to everyone, so most of the table is a literal. A
rule that has to name a native tool asks the runtime for the words instead:
`pdf-extraction` reaches `NativeSpellings.read_document`, and
:func:`antipattern_set_for` compiles the table once per plugin so a runtime
with no such tool ships the rule without one named.

Each entry pairs a stable id and a compiled regex with the message the hook and
auditor show. Beyond `pydantic` and the harness seam that spells those words,
this module imports only the standard library (directly and through
`lup.codescan.common`) so the auditor can load it cheaply;
`# lup:` marker detection stays in `lup.codescan.markers`, and the shared scan
core — ignore matching, comment-column tokenization, the masked line
projections, the line cursor — in `lup.codescan.common`, which this set's
consumers and the auditor import directly.

    A bare file-level `# lup: ignore` opts the whole file out (matching the

    scans nothing else. A typed file-level `# lup: ignore[id]` opts out only
    the named rule file-wide — and when nothing in the file still needs an
    id (no line trips it that an inline directive would not already cover),
    that id reports "spurious" at the directive line, so refiner and rule
    evolution cannot leave dead file-wide opt-outs behind. Docstring lines are skipped
    entirely: prose is not code, and no inline directive could ever guard it —
    a comment cannot open inside a string. (The hook still scans docstring
    lines at edit time; it sees only text fragments it cannot tokenize, so the
    hook stays strictly stricter than this audit.) Then, per line and per rule:

    - a tripped rule with no covering ignore -> "missing";
    - a typed `# lup: ignore[id]` naming a rule the line does not trip, or a
      bare ignore on a line that trips nothing -> "spurious";
    - a bare `# lup: ignore` that does silence the line -> "untyped".

    A hit a refiner refuted is not a trip at all, so a directive naming that
    rule there reports "spurious" — the audit drives the cleanup of markers
    refinement made unnecessary. Two sources feed this: the kernel's own AST
    exemptions (see :func:`refined_exempt_lines`), computed here, and
    whatever `refutations` the caller resolved — the typed grammar in
    `lup.codescan.grammar` passes the sites whose receiver a type oracle
    proved outside the rule's family. With no refutations supplied and no
    oracle behind them, every broad regex verdict stands.

    An ignore counts as a guard only where a comment actually starts (per the
    tokenizer), so a docstring or string literal that merely *mentions*
    `# lup: ignore` — and a note whose prose quotes it — guards nothing. Text
    that does not tokenize as Python falls back to a plain substring check.

    Where it may be written is one policy for every rule, line-shaped and
    AST-shaped alike: the line it guards, or standing alone directly above —

    comment is the one thing the formatter cannot wrap. A directive is graded
