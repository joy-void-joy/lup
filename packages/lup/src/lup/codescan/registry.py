# lup: ignore[native-spelling]
# The rule index necessarily documents the spellings other rules audit.
"""One index over every Lup rule family for discovery and the rule reference.

A rule id met in a `# lup: ignore[...]` directive, a hook denial, or an
auditor finding resolves here: every family — anti-pattern, boundary,
spelling, architecture — is listed with its scope, diagnostic, and the module
that defines and enforces it. `uv run lup-devtools dev rules` renders this
registry into the checked-in `docs/rules.md` reference that deny messages
point at, so no rule is discoverable only through the scanner that owns it.

A rule the typed grammar refines carries that refinement on its card, because
the reference is where the two surfaces are reconciled: the edit hook decides
on the spelling alone and the whole-file audit may decide otherwise once a
type oracle has resolved what the spelling refers to.
