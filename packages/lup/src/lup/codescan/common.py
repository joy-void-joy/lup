# lup: ignore[import-re, set-shape, empty-collection, dict-get, string-split] — the scanner that enforces these rules is written in the vocabulary they govern
"""Shared scanning core for the review-marker and anti-pattern scanners.

Both `lup.codescan.markers` and `lup.codescan.antipatterns` walk a file line by
line and must tell prose from code: a `#` that opens a real comment, or a
docstring, is where a review note or an `# lup: ignore` directive can live,
while the same characters inside an ordinary string literal are code.
Tokenizing and parsing the Python source answers that question once, here, so
neither scanner re-implements the other's mechanics.

The `# lup: ignore` escape hatch — inline, or as a standalone file-level
opt-out — is matched here too, `LineProjections` holds the token-masked line
views a context-aware rule scans, and `LineCursor` is the shared line walk that
lets a scanner absorb a note's continuation lines without index bookkeeping.

`PythonSource` is the unit whole-project scanners consume, and `Refutation`
the shape a refiner returns when it proves a matched line is not what its rule
is about — the one mechanism by which a broad regex hit is dropped with a
reason attached.

mechanism working, and the audit grades each one missing, bare, or dead.
