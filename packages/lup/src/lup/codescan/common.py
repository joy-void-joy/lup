# lup: ignore[import-re, set-shape, empty-collection, dict-get, string-split] — the scanner that enforces these rules is written in the vocabulary they govern
"""Shared scanning core for the review-marker and anti-pattern scanners.

Both `lup.codescan.markers` and `lup.codescan.antipatterns` walk a file line by
line and must tell prose from code: a `#` that opens a real comment, or a
docstring, is where a review note or an `# lup: ignore` directive can live,
while the same characters inside an ordinary string literal are code.
Tokenizing and parsing the Python source answers that question once, here, so
neither scanner re-implements the other's mechanics.

The `# lup: ignore` escape hatch — inline, or as a standalone file-level
opt-out — is matched here too, `LineProjections` holds the token-masked line
views a context-aware rule scans, and `LineCursor` is the shared line walk that
lets a scanner absorb a note's continuation lines without index bookkeeping.

`PythonSource` is the unit whole-project scanners consume, and `Refutation`
the shape a refiner returns when it proves a matched line is not what its rule
is about — the one mechanism by which a broad regex hit is dropped with a
reason attached.

    be had from: a file mid-edit that will not parse, or a language this
    grammar is not for.

    Sites rather than lines, because a rule is asked two questions and both
    are about the same nodes. Every gate asks which line fires, which is what

    are two that can disagree.

    it names, so a second pass reads the tree and takes the excess back out —
    which means the rule is stated twice, once too widely and once as the

doing something else — a one-argument `.replace` that renames a file, an
argless `.split` tokenizing prose, a `tuple[X, ...]` that is a sequence. Both
gates stay silent and a directive there would be reported spurious.

``refuted`` is the case no tree can decide, so the two surfaces answer
differently on purpose: the edit hook flags the spelling, and the whole-file
audit takes it back once a type oracle resolves what the receiver actually is.
`.get` on an HTTP client is the one this exists for. It is a third answer

class AntiPattern(BaseModel, arbitrary_types_allowed=True):

    Declared here rather than beside the tables that use it, because a project
    composing its own rules holds this and the harness declaration that carries
    them, and the tables sit above both.

    ``id`` is a stable kebab-case name a typed `# lup: ignore[id]` directive
    targets, so a single site can silence exactly one rule without opting out
    of the rest. Ids are pinned alongside the pattern and message by
    ``tests/unit/test_antipatterns.py`` and must stay in step with the hook.

    ``context`` declares the syntactic surface the pattern inspects. A "code"
    rule is matched against token-masked source — string literals and comments
    both blanked — so an identifier quoted in prose never trips it; a
    "comment" rule targets comment directives (`# type: ignore`, `# noqa`) and
    is matched with comments intact. Where no tokenizer applies (the
    TypeScript-family table, text that fails to tokenize) every rule scans the
    raw line — those rules are genuinely text-shaped.

    ``refiner`` is present when the regex is wider than the defect the rule
    names and an AST context settles the difference. It carries the function
    itself, so reading the rule tells you what narrows it rather than only
    that something does. The row carries its name, which
    :func:`lup.policy.kernel.edit.refiner_named` resolves back to the function,
    because a row projected into the hermetic runtime is primitive and cannot
    carry a callable; ``test_declared_refiners_are_the_kernel_refiners`` pins
    the two to the same objects, since a rule refined on one side only is
    exactly the split that makes a marker unremovable.

    ``matcher`` is present when the tree decides the rule outright: it selects
    the violating lines itself, and ``pattern`` is what the gate falls back to
    where no tree can be had — a file mid-edit that will not parse, or the
    TypeScript-family table, which this grammar is not for. A rule carrying
    one needs no ``refiner``, because there is no excess to take back out.

    ``examples`` are the snippets the rule is checked against, and carrying
    them on the declaration is what makes a rule impossible to add untested:
    a table-driven test runs every one of them through the gate, so there is
    no separate list of covered ids for a new rule to be missing from. The
    generated reference renders them too, which is why they are written as
    code somebody could paste rather than as the regex that happens to catch
    them.
