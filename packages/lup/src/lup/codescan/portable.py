"""The portable-content rule: prose may not spell what an adapter spells.

Nothing here lists a platform word. Every native word reaches a rendered
artifact through a :class:`NativeSpellings` method, so the vocabulary this rule
forbids is asked for rather than written down — a second copy would drift the
moment a runtime gained a location.

An ``Atom`` contributes its whole text, since every character of it is the
runtime's own. An ``Instruction`` frames text its caller supplied, so its
sentence says nothing about prose; the runtime declares the words within it
instead, and those are checked against what it actually spells.
