"""Typed AST grammar: rules that judge a site by what its subject resolves to.

The anti-pattern set detects *spellings*. A spelling is all the hermetic edit
hook can see — it classifies fragments of a proposed edit, which carry no
types and often do not parse — so `.get(` there means every `.get(` on every
receiver. The whole-file audit reads finished, parseable source and can do
better: it knows the AST, and through the `lup.codescan.oracle` port it can
ask a type checker what a name actually resolves to. `payload.get(...)` on a
mapping is the schema-hiding access the rule is about; the identical spelling
on an HTTP client or a route decorator is not, and the audit should say so
instead of leaving a contributor to suppress by reflex.

A rule here is three things: a **selector** that walks an AST and yields the
sites it is about, a **family** of classes the site's subject must belong to
for the rule to stand, and the prose explaining the refinement in the rule
reference. Selectors are typed callables rather than a matcher mini-language,
so a new rule is a function over `ast` rather than an extension to a schema —
`isinstance` narrowing over a project model union, for instance, selects call
arguments where this rule selects call receivers, and reuses everything else.

Resolution is deliberately structural. The oracle answers *where* a symbol is
declared, never what its type is named, and the engine reads the declaring
class out of that file's AST. So membership is decided by real declarations —
`dict` in typeshed's `builtins.pyi`, `_Environ(MutableMapping[...])` in
`os`'s stub — instead of by pattern-matching rendered type strings, and a
receiver whose declaration the checker cannot find yields no verdict at all.

That last case is the engine's default. A rule refutes a line only when every
site on it resolves to a declaration proven outside the family; unresolved,
unparseable, and oracle-less runs all leave the broad regex verdict standing,
so the refinement can only ever remove false positives and never hide a real
one.
