"""Which tool answers a URL better than fetching it would.

Behind a prediction-market URL is a market tool and behind a paper URL is a
paper tool, and the rendered page is a poorer answer than either API. This is
the table that says so — a URL shape, the tool it stands for, and how to build
that tool's arguments from what the shape matched. The same placement split as
`tool_policy`: the matching and dispatch are the library's, the table's content
belongs to the only thing that knows its own tools.

A fetch tool that always fetches is worse than the tools standing next to it:
behind a prediction-market URL is a market tool, behind a paper URL is a paper
tool, and the rendered page is a poorer answer than either API. This is the
table that says so — a URL shape, the tool it stands for, and how to build
that tool's arguments out of what the shape matched.

The table's *content* belongs to the adopting project, which is the only thing
that knows its own tools; what lives here is the matching and the dispatch. A
domain whose better tool cannot be reached from the URL alone registers a
redirection instead: no call, just the sentence naming what to reach for.

Registration sits beside each tool's own definition rather than in one central
list, so adding a route is a local edit and no import list has to stay in
sync::

    >>> routes.route(
    ...     r"arxiv\\.org/abs/(\\d+\\.\\d+)",
    ...     fetch_arxiv,
    ...     lambda m: {"paper_id": m.group(1)},
    ... )
    >>> routes.redirect("scholar.google.com", "Use search_arxiv instead.")

A fetch tool consults both before reaching the network: :meth:`ToolRoutes.dispatch`
answers with the better tool's own response, and :meth:`ToolRoutes.advice`
answers with the sentence to hand back instead.
