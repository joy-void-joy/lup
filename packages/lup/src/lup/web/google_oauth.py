"""Dashboard Google OAuth consent — client-type routing and the split-request
PKCE handling, scope-agnostic so each application binds its own scopes.

A dashboard runs OAuth as two separate requests: one builds the consent URL, a
later one exchanges the returned code. Each uses its own ``Flow`` object, so the
PKCE ``code_verifier`` the library generates when the URL is built must be
carried across to the exchange — a fresh exchange flow has none, which Google
rejects as ``invalid_grant: Missing code verifier``. These helpers make that
explicit: :class:`Consent` carries the verifier out of :func:`build_consent_url`
and :func:`exchange_code` accepts it back.

The scopes are a parameter rather than a module constant so one implementation
serves every caller — a Gmail/Calendar token and a Docs/Drive token alike.
:func:`exchange_code` returns the credentials without persisting; each caller
writes its own token file where it keeps it.
