"""One language-server session over stdio, answering arbitrary requests.

A language server resolves names the way the language does — through imports,
aliases, and re-exports — which is the difference between finding a symbol and
finding characters that look like one. The protocol is the same for every
question worth asking it, so the framing, the request/response pairing, and
the document bookkeeping are written once here and each caller supplies the
method it wants.

Nothing here decides which server to run: the executable and the workspace
root are supplied, so a project that type-checks with something else answers
these questions with something else. Failures are the caller's to interpret —
a sweep that can degrade to a weaker verdict and a tool that must report the
truth to an agent want opposite things from a server that will not start.
