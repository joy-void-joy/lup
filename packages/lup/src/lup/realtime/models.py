"""Tool input/output models for the realtime tools.

The vocabulary the agent-facing realtime tools (sleep, reply, debounce,
remind, schedule_action, context, meta) speak — one place both wirings share.
The in-process template tools and the subprocess :mod:`lup.realtime.relay`
both validate against these models, so a schema change reaches every backend
at once. This module depends on neither the scheduler core nor the relay.
