"""Tool-availability filtering: the mechanism, not the policy.

A session's tools pass through one policy object that decides what the
agent may call. *Which* exclusions apply is a per-project decision (API
keys, modes, session context), so this module owns only the machinery:
exclusion sets, tag filtering, the group predicate both backend paths
share, MCP-server assembly, and the hook-enforced allowlist. A project
subclasses :class:`BaseToolPolicy` and maps its own settings onto the
constructor's exclusion arguments.

Express each exclusion whichever way is cheaper to maintain:

- by tag, when you own the tool — annotate it ``tags=["requires:<dep>"]``
  at its definition and exclude the tag when the dependency is unmet;
  the requirement travels with the tool, so the policy never changes as
  tools come and go.
- by name, when you don't — group the full names of built-ins or
  external server tools per dependency and subtract them.
