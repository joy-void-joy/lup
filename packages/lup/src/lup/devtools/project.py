"""What an application tells the shared development tooling about itself.

The commands under :mod:`lup.devtools` are workflow rather than domain: they
scan, check, and generate against whichever repository they are pointed at.
A few facts about that repository are not theirs to infer — the import root
the application publishes, which initialization renames, and the roots whose
contents answer to some purpose other than production. Reaching back for
those by name is what kept these commands in an application package; taking
them as a declaration is what lets any adopter supply its own.
