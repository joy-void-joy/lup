"""Track repos to sync with and review their commits since the last sync.

These commands are the read/fetch half of ``/lup:update`` — the workflow that
pulls improvements *from* the lup template (and other tracked upstreams) *into*
this repo. ``/lup:update`` reviews every upstream commit since the last sync,
generalizes the domain-specific ones back into reusable scaffold, and applies
them; this module is what gives it the diffs to review and remembers how far it
got. ``status`` shows which upstreams have new commits, ``log``/``diff`` feed
the commit-by-commit review, and ``mark-synced`` advances the per-project
checkpoint once a review is done so the next run starts where this one stopped.

Reviewing a diff means reading the upstream's *current* code, so commits are
fetched into a local working copy before comparison (see ``ensure_local``):
``status`` stays read-only and never touches the network, while ``log``/``diff``
clone-or-fetch on demand. Each materialized upstream also gets a stable
``refs/<name>`` symlink so other commands (e.g. ``/lup:import``) can browse it
by name without re-resolving cache paths.

Two registry files declare what to track:

- sync.json (committed): the template's registry default, shipping only the
  lup entry so a fresh project can immediately pull template improvements.
  It is template scaffold: agents must never modify it — every personal
  registration belongs in sync.json.local, and the edit policy asks before
  any change to the tracked file.
- sync.json.local (gitignored): personal registrations — local paths, sync
  state, overrides by project name, and local-only projects. Set
  "ignore": true to skip a project (useful when you ARE the upstream).

The registry is direction-neutral: "sync" names the mechanism, not a
direction. Seen from a project built on the template, the shipped lup entry
is an upstream to pull improvements from; seen from the lup repo itself,
sync.json.local registers the downstream fleet whose commits /lup:update
reviews. Same tooling, opposite seats. A repo still carrying the legacy
names downstream.json / downstream.json.local is read as a fallback with a
deprecation warning; migrate by renaming the files.

The script merges both: .local entries override sync.json entries by name.
Projects with a URL but no local path are auto-cloned to .cache/sync/.

Examples::

    $ uv run lup-devtools sync status
    $ uv run lup-devtools sync log my-project
    $ uv run lup-devtools sync log my-project --no-stat
    $ uv run lup-devtools sync diff my-project abc1234
    $ uv run lup-devtools sync mark-synced my-project
    $ uv run lup-devtools sync mark-synced my-project --at 4c6293a6
    $ uv run lup-devtools sync setup my-project /path/to/repo --synced
    $ uv run lup-devtools sync setup my-project /path/to/repo --branch main
