"""Move a module between the two halves, and repoint every import of it.

Deciding a utility belongs in the library rather than the application is a
one-line judgement and a hundred-line consequence: the module moves, and
every site that named it has to say the new name. Doing that by hand is
where the judgement gets abandoned, so the mechanical half is a command.

Both halves, and that is the correction. Repointing importers while leaving
the file where it was is a tree in which nothing resolves, reported as a
success — the type check names it a step later, as an unresolved import,
detached from the command that produced it.

Tokens decide, text applies. ``tokenize`` reports every token with its exact
position, so a dotted module path in an import statement is located by
grammar rather than by pattern; the replacement is then spliced over that one
span, leaving the spacing, the parenthesized continuation, and the comment
beside it byte for byte untouched. Splicing a span rather than swapping token
for token is what lets a path change depth — a flat module moving under a
subpackage is the ordinary relocation, and three names do not fit where two
were. A module path appearing anywhere else — a log line, a docstring naming
the old home, a path in a comment — is not a module run in an import
statement and is never matched; :func:`surviving_mentions` reports those for
a human to read instead.

One form is deliberately left alone: ``from package import submodule`` is the
same tokens as importing a name from that package, and rewriting it would
mean guessing which. The repository's conventions ask for
``from module import symbol`` anyway, so the guess is not worth the reach —
such a site fails the type check with an unresolved import rather than
passing quietly, which is the outcome that gets it fixed.
