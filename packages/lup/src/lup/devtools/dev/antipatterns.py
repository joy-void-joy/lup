"""Audit repository source for missing and spurious `# lup: ignore` markers.

Backs `lup-devtools dev check --antipatterns` (and the standalone
`dev check`-row). Walks every tracked or untracked `.py`/TS-family file and
runs the single `lup.codescan.antipatterns` set over it — the same set the
edit hook enforces — reporting three classes the hook cannot catch after the
fact:

- **missing**: a line trips a rule but carries no `# lup: ignore` covering it
  (it slipped in past the hook, or predates the rule). Blocking.
- **spurious**: a `# lup: ignore[id]` (or a bare one) guards a rule the line
  does not trip — a dead directive to delete. Blocking.
- **untyped**: a bare `# lup: ignore` validly silences a line but names no
  rule. Advisory (does not fail the check) — surfaced so the migration to
  typed `# lup: ignore[id]` directives is gradual.

The set is shared with the hook; the verdicts need not be. This sweep reads
whole parseable files, so it hands `lup.codescan.grammar` a type oracle and
decides some rules more narrowly than a hook judging an untyped edit fragment
ever could. Every finding that narrowing drops is reported as a **refuted**
row carrying the declaration that settled it, and the directive that used to
guard it turns up as spurious on the next line of the report.
