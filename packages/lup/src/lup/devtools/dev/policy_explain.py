"""Ask the live permission policy what it would decide, and why.

Tuning a vocabulary against a session's actual friction needs the verdict for
a spelling, not a reading of the table that produces it: the shell classifier
recurses through substitutions, loops, and redirections, resolves paths
against the filesystem, and consults four declared row sets, so which of them
answered is rarely obvious from the command alone.

This runs the same composition a session runs — ``semantic_policy_for`` over
the project's own ``HookSet`` — so a verdict here is the verdict there rather
than an approximation of it. The generated dispatchers reach the identical
kernel through their own compiled halves, which is why one answer covers both
the in-process session and the native plugin.
