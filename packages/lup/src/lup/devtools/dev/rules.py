INTRODUCTION = (
    "# Lup rule reference\n\n"
    "Every executable Lup rule family — anti-pattern, boundary, spelling, and "
    "architecture rules — is indexed here from `lup.codescan.registry`, with the "
    "module that defines and enforces each rule. An edit-hook denial cites its "
    "rule id and this reference. Lup rules enforce repository-specific "
    "architecture and editing conventions; Ruff remains the source of standard "
    "Python diagnostics. The matching examples for anti-patterns are their "
    "canonical regular-expression shapes, so this reference cannot drift from "
    "the edit hook or repository auditor.\n\n"
    "## Typed suppressions\n\n"
    "Suppress one deliberate site with `# lup: ignore[rule-id]` and a reason. "
    "Comma-separated ids cover a line that intentionally matches several rules. "
    "A directive sits on the line it guards, or stands alone directly above "
    "it when the reason is too long to fit inline; nowhere else reaches. A "
    "typed directive in the file's opening comment block applies file-wide. "
    "Bare "
    "`# lup: ignore` remains parseable but is reported as untyped; a stale typed "
    "directive is blocking. `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, and `# pyright: ignore` "
    "are separate forbidden shapes.\n\n"
    "The **Suppression** column says whether a directive reaches a rule at all. "
    "Most are soft: they name a shape that is usually wrong and occasionally the "
    "only thing that works, so a typed directive is a reasoned exception and the "
    "audit grades it. A rule marked **refused** is strong — its replacement is "
    "right every time, which leaves a directive nothing to express but a decision "
    "to keep the defect. Those rules ignore every directive, report the violation "
    "anyway, and report the directive itself as spurious; the only way past one is "
    "to write the replacement its diagnostic names.\n\n"
    "```python\n"
    "cache: dict[str, int] = {}  # lup: ignore[empty-collection] — mutable fold\n"
    "```\n\n"

    "The edit hook sees a fragment of a proposed edit: no parse tree, no "
    "types, and a hermetic kernel that may not reach a type checker. So it "
    "decides on the spelling alone, and every rule above means exactly its "
    "matching example there. The whole-file audit reads finished source and "
    "resolves what a matched name refers to through the type oracle in "
    "`lup.codescan.oracle`, so the rules below decide more narrowly in "
    "`lup-devtools dev check` than they do at edit time — a hook denial you "
    "believe is wrong is answered by the audit, which reports the "
    "declaration that settled it. Where the oracle is unavailable the audit "
    "falls back to the hook's broad verdict, and a `# lup: ignore` left "
    "guarding a refuted line is reported as a dead directive.\n\n"
