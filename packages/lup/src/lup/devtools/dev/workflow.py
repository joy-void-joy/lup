"""The continuous-integration workflow that runs a project's own gate.

A generated tree goes stale the moment the library that compiles it moves, and
nothing in a checkout says so until something asks. ``dev check`` asks, so what
CI owes the project is to run it — one job, not a second list of gates that
drifts from the first. Generated rather than scaffolded for the same reason:
a copy handed over once is a list nobody updates.

Both steps are spelled with the same constants the git guards install, so a
contributor who never armed the hooks is refused here by the identical
commands rather than by a second rule about them.
