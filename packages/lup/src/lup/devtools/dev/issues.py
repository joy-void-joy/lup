"""Reading a project's tracker issues, and answering them where they are read.

The library stays free of any forge: `lup.resolver` knows an issue only as a
number, a URL and some text. Reaching a tracker is workflow tooling's job, so
it lives here beside the pull-request queries that already use `gh`, and a
project on a different tracker supplies its own reader rather than waiting for
the library to learn an API it has no business knowing.

# lup: solved: This module reads and comments, but filing an issue is still a raw
# `gh issue create --body-file` at the agent's own hand. Reporting friction is
# a step the workflow prescribes, so it should be a devtools command like every
# other prescribed step — one that knows the repository, so the report cannot
# be filed against the wrong one, and that carries the friction report's shape
# (command, exact error, state left behind, recovery cost, owning component)
# rather than leaving each session to remember it.
