    The directory ACL beside this bounds the worker's filesystem reach and
    says nothing about what it may fetch or run — so egress and shell passed
    unjudged, with the OS sandbox as the only floor. This supplies exactly
    those verdicts, scoped to the tools it has rules for: a headless worker
    has no human to answer an `ask`, so judging a tool this vocabulary cannot
    classify would deny it, and would outrank the ACL's own grant.

    The worker is autonomous because its edits are reviewed by an actor of
    this run, which is the same fact the generated tree derives its
    autonomous list from.

    ``grants`` is asked what the lease holds at each judgment, over the same
    document the session environment names — so this judge and the lease's
    deployed dispatcher release exactly the same gates, including one granted
    after both were built.

    ``semantics`` is how one runtime's calls become the vocabulary this
    policy judges. It is a parameter rather than a constant because both
    runtimes have that decode now, and hardcoding one was what left the
    other's workers judged by nothing.

    ``sandbox`` is the session's own confinement, read from the declaration
    the factory opens it with rather than from the runtime. Taking the
    runtime's word granted an escape the session forbade — rendered onto the
    wire, dropped without a word, and the call left confined to fail on
    whatever it wrote first. Asking the session instead is what lets a
    worker's toolchain be placed outside and actually get there.

    Only the placement is taken from it. What the posture says about
    confinement stays out of the verdict, because the kernel spends that fact
    on a substitution this host cannot afford: its arm takes ``defer`` and
    ``ask`` together, so where there is no human to answer, every guarded
    verdict becomes a run rather than a refusal — ``find -delete`` and ``git
    push --delete`` among them, and a ``# lup: escalate:`` marker, which
    resolves to an ask, turned into the way to avoid the human it exists to
    summon. A worker keeps the fail-closed floor until it can answer a
    question through the channel it already holds.

    It composes here, outside the factory that calls it, because the defect
    this shape exists to prevent was never in a verdict: the kernel answered
    correctly every time and the session handed it host facts it did not
    have. A composition only a running resolver can build is one no test
    reaches, and this one shipped its own widening once already.
