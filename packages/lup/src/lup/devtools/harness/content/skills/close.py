### 2. Get PR status

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev pr status --json
```

If no PR is found, check if the user passed a PR number as an argument. If still nothing, report the error and stop.

### 3. Evaluate reviews

**If there are unresolved review comments or requested changes:**

1. Display all review comments clearly formatted
2. Show which reviews requested changes vs approved
3. **Stop here.** Tell the user to fix the issues and re-run `"""

**If all reviews are approved (or no reviews but checks pass):**

            ),
            models.TextPart(

### 4. Merge the PR

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev pr merge <PR_NUMBER>
```

### 5. Clean up

Delete the merged branch:

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev delete <BRANCH_NAME>
```

### 6. Report

Summarize what was done: PR merged (with link), cleanup results.

## Guidelines

- Always show review comments before merging -- never skip review feedback
- The user approves the merge before it happens -- never merge unprompted
