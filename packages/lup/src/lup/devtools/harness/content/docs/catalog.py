"""The documents lup publishes about its own machinery, as a declared roster.

One entry per document, each naming the path it renders to, the semantic id
ownership records it under, and the typed module it renders from. A project
composes these with its own and hands the result to generation, so a page
that is not declared does not exist and a file under ``docs/`` produced from
nowhere is deleted as unowned.

Explicit imports rather than a dynamic scan: a misspelled or missing module
is a type-checking error rather than a page that quietly stopped publishing.
