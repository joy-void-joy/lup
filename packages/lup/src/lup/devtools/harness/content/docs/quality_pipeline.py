Three layers guard the repository. Each runs at a different moment and
catches a class of problem the others cannot.

## Commit time: the drift guard

`uv run lup-devtools dev commit-guard install` writes a git `pre-commit` hook
whose body is one command — `uv run lup-devtools harness check all` — so a
commit is refused while any generated artifact differs from what its source
renders. `dev worktree create` arms it, re-running install refreshes a body
left by an older library, `dev commit-guard status` says what a clone would
run, and `uninstall` removes it. A `pre-commit` hook written by anything else
is reported rather than replaced.

That command is the same one the pipeline runs and the same drift verdict
`dev check` reports, so the three places that can refuse stale output reach
one computation instead of three that can disagree.

The check reads every generated artifact every time, with no path pattern
deciding when it applies. It costs well under a second, and the alternative
is a second belief about which commits could change generated output: the
sources compiled into the plugin trees are copied there verbatim, so
rewording a comment in one makes both trees stale without changing anything
either does.

Unique catch: a canonical harness edit committed without its regenerated
artifacts, or a hand-edit to an owned artifact, is refused before the commit
exists instead of minutes later in CI. Formatting, lint, type, and test
problems are deliberately not duplicated at commit time; the per-push gate
below owns them. Two things a hook cannot refuse: a partial stage — canonical
source staged while its regenerated artifacts sit unstaged in an otherwise
current worktree — because it reads the worktree rather than the index, and a
`--no-verify` commit, which skips every hook by asking to. Both are the layer
below's, which is why both layers exist.

## Every pull request and push: quality and harness drift

`.github/workflows/quality.yml` runs on every pull request and on pushes to
`main` and `dev`. Its first step is `harness check all` — the same command
the commit hook installs, spelled from the same constant — and its second is
`dev check`: `ruff format --check`, `ruff check`, `pyright`, both `pytest`
suites, the review-note report, the anti-pattern rules, the native seam
boundaries, library placement, generated-tree drift, and the guidance budget.

Unique catch: this is the authoritative gate. It binds whether or not a
contributor armed the commit guard, and it is the only layer that runs the
full static and unit-test bar. It never regenerates or commits.

## Scheduled: native nightly

`.github/workflows/native-nightly.yml` runs on a daily cron and on manual
dispatch. The deterministic `evidence` job installs the real Claude and
Codex CLIs and runs `uv run lup-devtools harness doctor all
--strict-evidence` against the typed evidence ledger. The secrets-gated
`native` job runs the full `pytest -m integration` lane across the installed
CLIs.

Unique catch: breakage observable only through a real native CLI boundary —
installed-version drift against the evidence ledger, and live hook, plugin,
and session behavior — which is too slow and credential-bound for the
per-push gate. Release-evidence rules for this lane are in
[contributing.md](contributing.md).

## What a project built on lup runs in CI

One command:

```yaml
- run: uv run lup-devtools dev check
```

That is deliberately the whole of the gate. `dev check` is the same bar a
checkout runs locally — format, lint, types, tests, review notes,
anti-patterns, seam boundaries, library placement, generated-tree drift, and
the guidance budget — so a green local run and a green pipeline cannot mean
different things. Putting `harness check all` in a step ahead of it, as this
repository does, buys a faster and more specific refusal of the one failure
a contributor can produce without running anything; it reads the same verdict
either way.

`uv run lup-devtools dev commit-guard install` is the local half, and it is
the project's to arm rather than the framework's to impose: it writes into
`.git`, which is the contributor's, not the repository's.

Nothing is generated into an adopter's `.github/`. A workflow file is the
project's own, and a framework that wrote one would be claiming a schedule,
a runner, and a trigger policy that are not its to choose. This repository
generates its own `quality.yml` because it is *this* project's workflow; an
adopter writes the three lines above wherever its pipeline lives.

## Why the guard runs at commit time and in CI

ADR-013 in [dev-tooling-decisions.md](dev-tooling-decisions.md) records the
decision: a check that runs when somebody remembers to run it is a warning,
so the drift check sits on the path a commit must cross. The hook catches it
before history is written; the pipeline catches a hook nobody installed, and
the partial stage a worktree read cannot see.
