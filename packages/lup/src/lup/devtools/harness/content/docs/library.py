`packages/lup` is the reusable half of this repository: a standalone published
package that knows how to run an agent turn, compile a harness, decide a
permission, and resolve reviewed feedback — without knowing which vendor is
behind any of it. It is the larger of the two code components and the one a
downstream project depends on.

The rule that shapes every module: **shared code never names a provider.**
Native config, hook payloads, command spellings, manifests, and wire schemas
live inside `lup/adapters/`. Everything above the adapters speaks contracts.
A third backend implements those contracts without editing a shared registry,
because there is no registry to edit.

## The front door

`packages/lup/src/lup/__init__.py` re-exports a deliberately small runtime
surface — the one place in the library where a barrel is allowed, because it
declares a public API:

```python
from lup import (
    SessionFactory,   # open configured conversations
    SessionHandle,    # an opened session, plus optional fork capability
    TurnHandle,       # an accepted turn, plus optional events/interrupt/steer
    TurnInput,        # portable user input
    TurnRequest,      # what to run, and the type to come back
    TurnResult,       # a validated, typed result
    turn_request,     # request factory
    query,            # one-shot: factory in, typed result out
)
```

The shortest useful program is one call:

```python
factory = create_claude_session_factory(ClaudeSessionConfig(model="..."))
result = await query(factory, turn_request(TurnInput(text="summarize"), Summary))
summary = result.output
```

`query` is the one-shot convenience. For anything with more than one turn, open
a session and start turns on it — the same contracts, held longer.

## Layering

Four tiers, and imports only ever point downward.

1. **`lup.types`** — the portable content and tool vocabulary every other
   package speaks: `JsonValue`/`JsonObject`, `ToolName`/`ToolGrant`,
   `LupContentBlock`, `LupMessage`, `Usage`, `SubagentSpec`.
2. **`contracts` and `models`** — each subpackage carries both. `models` owns
   the vocabulary; `contracts` owns the narrow capability seams. Contracts
   import types only, so a fake implementation needs nothing else.
3. **Implementations** — composition, wrappers, validation, reconciliation,
   rule evaluation. These import their own package's contracts and models, and
   nothing from `adapters`.
4. **`lup.adapters.claude` / `lup.adapters.codex`** — the only packages that
   name a vendor. They implement the contracts above and are imported only by
   named composition roots.

`lup.codescan.boundaries` enforces tier 4 mechanically with the
`seam-boundary` rule: a concrete adapter import outside `lup/adapters/`,
the tests, the examples, or a named application composition root is a
build failure, not a review comment.

## Where a module belongs

Three questions place every module, and they point in different directions.

**Outward — would another project built on lup want this?** If yes it belongs
in `packages/lup/` even when only this application uses it today, because the
library never imports the application: a utility left in `src/lup_template/`
is unreachable from here and has to move later. The same test applies to
values. The library may declare one only when it could not have chosen
otherwise — a language's file suffixes, a provider's wire spelling, a closed
enum the library itself defines. Everything else is a judgement, and reaches
an adopter as an overridable default they replace rather than a constant they
fork. `library-default` in `lup.codescan.boundaries` is the mechanical half of
that; canonicity it cannot judge, so a canonical table says so with
`# lup: ignore[library-default]` and a reason.

**Inward — is this the tooling layer, or what the tooling layer is built on?**
`lup/devtools/` is the development CLI an adopter inherits. Provider-neutral
code a program would want with no CLI in front of it sits above `devtools/`,
and `devtools/` imports it; the reverse never holds. A value follows the same
rule at module scale: a page's default port belongs to the module serving that
page, not to a module about checkout directories that happens to be imported
by both.

**Downward — is this a subject of its own, or part of one?** A top-level
package answers a question no sibling answers. One that exists to serve a
single subject nests under it — and library code follows its driver only as
far as the library edge, so a package driven from `lup/devtools/harness/`
nests under `lup/harness/` rather than moving into `devtools/`, which would
pull provider-neutral code into the tooling layer.

## The packages

### `runtime` — how one turn runs

The engine. `contracts.py` declares the lifecycle seams — open a session,
start a turn, await a result — as one-to-three-method capabilities.
`models.py` holds the shared turn vocabulary: opaque `SessionId`/`TurnId`,
the `TurnBlock` union (`TurnTextBlock`, `TurnThinkingBlock`,
`TurnToolCallBlock`, `TurnToolResultBlock`), and the generic
`TurnRequest[T]`/`TurnResult[T]`.

Everything optional is a decorator or an absent capability, never a flag:
`wrappers.py` layers timeouts, budgets, retries, correction, tracing, usage,
and display around a factory; `routing.py` selects a configured recipe from an
immutable `ModelRoute` list and fails closed on an unknown model;
`background.py` coalesces state wakes into turns on a persistent session;
`output.py` binds a fresh `submit_output` tool and store to each typed turn.

Unsupported behavior is *absent* from the handle rather than present and
raising. If `TurnHandle.steer` is `None`, that backend cannot steer.

### `harness` — declaration to disk

Compiles one provider-neutral declaration into native plugin trees, with a
proof of what it owns. `models.py` holds the declaration graph
(`Harness` → `Plugin` → `Skill`/`Agent`/`HookSet`) and the rendered
`Artifact`/`ArtifactTree`. Prompt bodies are ordered typed parts —
`TextPart` for prose, `SkillInvocation`/`NativePath`/`ArgumentsRef` and their
siblings for anything a runtime spells its own way.

The pipeline is `validation` → `ownership` → `reconciliation` →
`materialization`, plus `proposals` for the reviewed patch transport back to
canonical source and `process`/`environment` for launching a native CLI.
`generation.py` holds the small deterministic helpers the stages share,
including the do-not-edit banner every commentable generated artifact opens
with. [harness.md](harness.md) walks the whole pipeline.

### `policy` — one decision, two homes

The permission core, split so the same verdict can be reached inside this
library and inside a generated plugin that cannot import it.

`policy/kernel/` is hermetic: stdlib-only, statically audited imports,
primitive rows in and a decision out. It is copied *verbatim* into every
generated tree, which is why a traceback from a hook still points at real
canonical line numbers. Above it, `rules.py` validates application inputs as
Pydantic surfaces and erases them into kernel rows, `chain.py` composes
policies deny-before-ask, and `bundle.py` assembles the kernel source plus
rendered data rows for generation. [permissions.md](permissions.md) is the
full lattice.

### `resolver` — reviewed feedback to an integration branch

A persisted state machine over concerns. `models.py` holds schema-versioned
records; `dag.py` validates and orders the concern graph; `state.py` persists
it atomically under a file lock; `run.py` names the one live state a run
holds, with the lock and the observer that guard it; `orchestrator.py` owns
every git side effect (leases, worktrees, commits, dependency bases);
`mailbox.py` carries questions and answers as files so any door can write
while the run holds its lease. Each phase is a collaborator over those rather
than a method on one class: `questions.py` publishes and promotes,
`actors.py` holds one durable session per actor, `turns.py` puts the prompts
to them, `joins.py` brings branches together and settles what that breaks,
`verification.py` runs one tree through the verification set, and
`execution.py` drives one concern's revision loop. `core.py` composes them
and owns only the sequence. [resolver.md](resolver.md) covers the lifecycle.

### `codescan` — the executable conventions

The rule engine behind `lup-devtools dev check` and both generated edit hooks.
`common.py` provides comment-column tokenization, docstring detection, and
ignore-directive parsing; `markers.py` finds `# lup:` review notes;
`antipatterns.py`, `boundaries.py`, `capabilities.py`, and `portable.py` are
the rule families; `registry.py` indexes them all into
[rules.md](rules.md).

### `adapters` — the vendor edge

`adapters/claude/` and `adapters/codex/` each implement the same four seams:
`runtime.py` (open sessions behind the runtime contracts), `harness.py`
(render the declaration into that runtime's tree), `harness_runtime.py`
(probe the installed CLI for evidence), and `native.py` (decode hook payloads
into policy events, render decisions back). `adapters/harness.py` composes the
renderers into whole-tree compilers.

Each also carries what only it needs: Claude a personal account registry that
`runtime/profile_tree.py` answers with the directories a project keeps instead,
Codex a
typed JSON-RPC transport to `codex app-server`. Neither is mirrored for
symmetry's sake. [platform-differentiation.md](platform-differentiation.md)
is the map of every difference.

### The rest

Every remaining top-level entry, and what makes it one. `types` is tier 1
above and `__init__` is the front door; the rest each answer a question no
sibling answers.

| Package | Solves |
| --- | --- |
| `devtools` | The development CLI an adopter inherits rather than forks: worktrees and branches, trace and Python introspection, the resolver supervisor, the sync registry, version bookkeeping. Ships the whole roster — `roster.py` wires every sub-app over one `DevtoolsDeclarations`, and an application declares only what it retires and what only it has, so a sub-app added here reaches it on the next lock refresh instead of waiting to be noticed. Requires the `web` extra for the supervisor. |
| `channels` | File-backed channels — a value that settles, an ordered log, and the atomic publish under both. The widest dependency here: `harness`, `resolver`, `runtime`, `realtime`, `telemetry`, and `adapters` all write through it, which is what makes it a package rather than a helper inside any one of them. |
| `codeintel` | An LSP client and the tools built on it, so a name is resolved rather than grepped. Serves an agent's toolset and the pyright oracle behind `dev check` — two consumers on opposite sides of the library, neither of which owns it. |
| `gitlocks` | Why git cannot take the lock its config writes need. A confinement owning the path and a lock some git left behind when it died both surface as `File exists`, and the remedies are opposite, so telling them apart reads the mount state and the lock's age rather than the message. The same two-consumers shape as `codeintel`: the resolver's orchestrator and `devtools/utils` both diagnose it, and neither owns it. |
| `subagents` | Spec-driven delegation for engines with no native subagents, dispatching the same `SubagentSpec` roster the native path uses. |
| `tool_policy` | Tool-availability filtering: the mechanism, not the policy. A project subclasses `BaseToolPolicy` and maps its own settings onto it, which is the placement rule in miniature — the machinery is the library's, every exclusion is the adopter's. |
| `markdown` | Rendering Markdown that is generated rather than authored, escaping at the leaf where data enters the document. Only `devtools` renders such tables today, but nothing in it is about development tooling. |
| `web` | What a page served on this machine does to stay local-only: the loopback bind refusal, the `Host` check that DNS rebinding would otherwise walk past, and the browser round-trip an installed OAuth client needs. One subject — a local HTTP surface a browser reaches — and the OAuth half is reached by a downstream project rather than by anything here, which is the outward test answering in the affirmative. The two user-facing pages, `devtools/dashboard` and `devtools/supervisor`, sit *on* this; it does not belong beside them. |
| `workspace` | Where a run's data lives: version-aware paths, the `SessionContext` that crosses a process boundary, session history, and the note directories a session may touch. |
| `realtime` | The wake/act/sleep lifecycle for persistent agents. `scheduler.py` stands alone; `relay.py` layers a subprocess mailbox transport on top and is never imported by it. |
| `telemetry` | What a run records about itself: markdown trace plus machine-readable sidecar, console rendering, per-tool metrics with a file-backed flush for subprocess tools. |
| `usage` | One account's metered usage, whichever runtime billed it: the windows a plan meters and when each clears, where the tokens went day by day, and the display that draws both. Ships no roster — each adapter declares the entry that reads its own runtime into this shape, so a runtime joins the display by being read rather than by growing a command beside it. |
| `sandbox` | A Docker-isolated Python REPL — mount topology, container lifecycle, and the exec-multiplexed socket protocol. Requires the `docker` extra. |
| `resilience` | `throttle` bounds concurrency and minimum call interval; `retry` re-runs a coroutine with exponential backoff. |
| `hooks` | SDK-agnostic hook models and factories: permission hooks, tool allowlists, gates, nudges, capture. |
| `mcp` | The `lup_tool` decorator and `create_mcp_server`, with typed input models and error propagation that actually reaches the caller. |
| `reflect` | Reflect-before-output gates: a flag-based `ReflectionGate` and a verdict-aware `ReviewGate`. |

### The target layout

The roster above is where the tree stands and, with one exception, where the
three questions put it. The exception is `resolver`, whose home is
`lup/harness/resolver/`: its only driver is `lup.devtools.harness.resolve`,
so it is part of the harness subject rather than a sibling of it, and the
downward question stops it at the library edge — following the driver into
`devtools/` would move provider-neutral code into the tooling layer.

`usage/` and the `usage/` beside each adapter are worth naming next to it as
the placement rule worked all the way through. What an account publishes is
the only thing that differs between runtimes — which windows it meters,
whether it splits a day's tokens by model — so that is what stays at the
vendor edge, and the report shape, the pacing bars and the rendering are
decided once above it. Neither reader carries a command of its own: each
declares an entry, and an application composes the ones it wants, so no Typer
app sits under `adapters/` and nothing above `devtools/` imports one.

The outward question also runs the other way, and `dev check` asks it on every
run: the `application placement` row names each module under the application's
`devtools/` that imports nothing from the application. It reports rather than
fails, because the template is copied and frozen the moment an adopter takes
it while `packages/lup` reaches them through an ordinary dependency bump — so
the row is a debt that shrinks, and this is where its verdicts are settled
rather than a list kept somewhere else. Two modules answer it today.
`devtools/setup.py` is where it belongs: this project's own integrations
written as data, which is exactly what importing nothing looks like when a
module is this project's judgement. `devtools/dev/library.py` is not — how a
project obtains lup, across the published, git, local, and linked modes, is a
question every adopter has and none of it is about this application, so its
home is `lup/devtools/dev/`.

## Building on it

The library is the dependency; your application is the composition root. That
inversion is the whole design, and it has three practical consequences.

**Name the provider exactly once.** Choose an adapter factory in one function,
pass the resulting `SessionFactory` everywhere else. `seam-boundary` will tell
you when a second site appears.

**Compose capabilities rather than configuring an object.** Timeouts, budgets,
retries, persistence, and tracing are `DecoratingSessionFactory` layers you
add individually, not fields on a client.

**Let typed output be the only output.** Bind a Pydantic type to the turn and
read `TurnResult.output`. A missing submission raises a typed error carrying
the blocks, usage, duration, and validation history — it cannot arrive as an
empty success.

`src/lup_template` is the worked example of all three; see
[template.md](template.md).
