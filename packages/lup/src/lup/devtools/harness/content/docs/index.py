"""How a documentation index is rendered from the pages actually declared.

The index is the one page whose subject is the other pages, so it is the one
page that goes stale silently: a document renamed or added on either side of
the library boundary leaves a row pointing nowhere, and nothing fails. Rows
are therefore built from the declarations — a link is the path a `Document`
already renders to, never a filename written down a second time.

What a page *answers* is index copy rather than a property of the page, so it
stays with the group that lists it. The preamble and epilogue are a project's
own words about its own repository, and pass through untouched.
