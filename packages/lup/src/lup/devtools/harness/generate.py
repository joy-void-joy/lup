"""Ownership-safe generation engine beneath the harness CLI.

Each frozen ``GenerationRecipe`` compiles the canonical catalog through an
adapter, validates the rendered tree, reconciles it against recorded
ownership, materializes a conflict-free proposal, and saves the manifest.
Inspection exposes the same pipeline without writes. Console-facing command
bodies live in ``drift`` and ``reconcile``; ``composition`` maps target names
to concrete recipes.
