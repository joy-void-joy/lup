"""Typer command tree for ``lup-devtools harness``: wiring only, no bodies.

Each command delegates to the module owning its concern: ``drift`` for
generation and checking, ``reconcile`` for local-difference workflows,
``doctor`` for runtime evidence, ``resolve`` for the persisted resolver,
and ``launch`` for the native launchers. Every one of them works on already
concrete compositions, so the targets a project declares are what this tree
operates on and no command names a runtime of its own.

A launch command exists exactly when its adapter is among those targets: a
project generating one native tree is not offered a launcher for the other.
