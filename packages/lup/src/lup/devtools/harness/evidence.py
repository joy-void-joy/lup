"""Typed native-evidence ledger backing the doctor's version-drift trigger.

`docs/native-capabilities.md` records the CLI and SDK versions each native
contract was last probed against. This module is the machine-readable row set
behind that prose: `lup-devtools harness doctor` compares the *installed*
versions against these accepted ones and surfaces a drift warning whenever an
installed component is newer — the trigger to re-probe the native contracts
and refresh the ledger. Locally the drift is a warning; the nightly lane runs
doctor with `--strict-evidence`, turning drift into a nonzero exit so evidence
re-probes have a schedule instead of a habit.
