"""Console drift reporting and reported generation for generate and check.

Wraps the ``generate`` engine in the console surfaces the CLI shares: drift
summaries, generation summaries, and conflict-aborted generation. Owns the
bodies of the ``generate`` and ``check`` commands, and reaches the rule
reference alongside them so one command settles every generated artifact
rather than leaving the repository-wide one to be remembered separately.

:class:`DriftVerdict` is the single reading every refusing path shares: the
commit hook, continuous integration, and ``dev check`` all ask
:func:`inspect_drift` rather than composing the same two halves themselves,
so no tree can be stale to one of them and current to another.
