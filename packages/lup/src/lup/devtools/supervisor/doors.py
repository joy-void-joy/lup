"""Console doors onto a resolver run's question mailbox.

Each of these is a handful of lines because the mailbox is just files, and
each is strictly better than a prompt on the run's own stdin ever was: they
work from another shell, or another host, *while the run is still waiting*.

None of them may take :meth:`ResolverStateRepository.exclusive`. A run holds
that lock for its whole life, so a door that reached for it could only ever
serve runs that had already finished — which is exactly the class of runs a
