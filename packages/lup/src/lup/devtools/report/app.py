"""The general report surface: everything left to implement, in one place.

Every other surface here answers one question — `dev comments` what is still
being asked, `harness check` whether the generated trees are current, `dev
branches` what has not landed, `harness resolve supervise` what one run is
doing. None of them answers "what is left", which is the question a session
ends on and the one a report is written to record.

So this composes them rather than recomputing any of it, and shares its shape
with the report skill: the skill writes what a session knows on top of what
this can see, into the same file, rewritten whole.

Examples::

    $ uv run lup-devtools report
    $ uv run lup-devtools report --json
    $ uv run lup-devtools report --write
