"""Where a report's items come from: the surfaces that already compute them.

Nothing here scans anything itself. Each topic is answered by the command
that owns it — the marker scan behind `dev comments`, the drift inspection
behind `harness check`, the containment walk behind `dev branches`, the run
state behind `harness resolve supervise` — and this composes their answers
into one shape. A second scanner beside those would be a second answer to
compare against theirs, which is the reason the surface composes rather than
replaces.
