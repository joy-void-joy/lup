"""What "everything left to implement" is, and where a written one lives.

Declaration only. The command surface computes one of these from the scans
that already answer each topic, and the report skill writes one down after a
session — so the two halves share a shape instead of each describing
outstanding work in its own words, which is the difference between one report
mechanism and two that never met.

Nothing here scans, renders a CLI, or imports one. That is what lets the
skill's own prose recite the topic roster from the same declaration the
command fills in, the way the sub-app roster is recited rather than restated.

Scratch, so it is gitignored and never reaches a diff, a reviewer, or a

whole from the surfaces every time, so a stale one cannot outlive what it
