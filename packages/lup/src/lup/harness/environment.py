"""Non-interactive shell environment for agent-run commands.

Credential helpers prompt on ``/dev/tty`` — the terminal the native TUI or
resolver console owns — so a passphrase or editor prompt raised from an agent
shell wedges the whole session instead of failing. These variables make every
such command fail fast with a readable error: ssh refuses to prompt (keys
already loaded in ssh-agent keep working), git never opens an editor or pager,
and gh and keyring lookups stay non-interactive. The devtools launch and
resolver flows merge these defaults beneath the inherited environment at
every agent spawn point. Explicit caller values win except ``VIRTUAL_ENV``:
the child project must select its own environment from its working directory.
