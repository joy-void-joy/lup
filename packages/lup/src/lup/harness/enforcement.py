"""Build the semantic policies a declared hook set describes.

Generated native plugins erase a :class:`~lup.harness.models.HookSet` into
primitive rows and enforce them from their own dispatcher. A session this
program composes and runs itself has no dispatcher, so it needs the same
declaration as live policy objects — otherwise enforcement is written twice
and drifts, which is how a resolver worker came to be bounded by a directory
ACL while every generated plugin judged the same acts semantically.

The path rules here compile to exactly the rows :mod:`lup.policy.bundle`
renders, and a test holds them equal. A rule that reached one tree and not
the other would mean a run's permissions depended on who launched it.
