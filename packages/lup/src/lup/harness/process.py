"""Local native-executable launching and its request/status vocabulary.

Defines the ``ProcessLauncher`` seam and implements it for everything that
must run a native CLI: devtools harness launch and doctor flows and the
resolver's git and skill invocations. Its request and status models live here
because launchers are their only producers.
