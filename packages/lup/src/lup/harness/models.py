Codex stops adding project documentation once the combined size reaches

not an error a reader ever sees, it is *silent truncation*. The unit is bytes
for the same reason: that is what the vendor limits, and UTF-8 punctuation
makes a document's byte count exceed its character count, so a character-based
check runs looser than the real cap and passes documents that would be cut.

Claude has no equivalent setting — its guidance file is loaded in full
whatever its length. Lup applies one number to both trees anyway, so the two
runtimes read the same document rather than one reading a longer one.

This is a default rather than a constant: the number mirrors a real vendor
default, but which ceiling a given project wants is its own call. Pass
``budget`` to the checks below to state a different one. See § A Constant
Should Probably Be An Overridable Default in ``docs/patterns.md``.

What a session pays for is the rendered document, so that is what the adapters
check as they compile it. A typed part costs whatever its adapter spells it as,

skill or a denial message surfaces at the right moment belongs in a generated
