"""The usage sub-app, composed from whichever runtimes an application reads.

The library ships no roster here either: each adapter declares one entry
beside the reader that answers it, and the application names the entries it
wants. Every command they produce is the same command — the options, the
three modes, and the rendering are decided once — so a runtime joins the
display by being read, never by growing a command of its own.
