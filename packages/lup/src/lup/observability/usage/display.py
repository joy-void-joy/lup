"""The one usage display, over whichever runtime's reader fills it.

A display is the same program on every runtime — read, render, print, or hold
a live panel and read again — so this composes a :class:`UsageReader` rather
than being written once per account. The reader is the only thing that knows
a credential, an endpoint, or a wire shape; nothing below it does.
