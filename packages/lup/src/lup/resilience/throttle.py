"""Rate limiting combining concurrency control and temporal spacing.

Provides a generic Throttle class that enforces both a maximum number of
concurrent requests (semaphore) and a minimum time interval between request
starts. This prevents API rate limit violations during concurrent agent
sessions in batch mode.

Throttle instances are designed as module-level singletons, configured from
settings, and shared across all concurrent sessions in the process.

Examples:
    Pure concurrency limiting (up to 3 simultaneous requests)::

        >>> api_throttle = Throttle(max_concurrent=3)
        >>> async with api_throttle.slot():
        ...     result = await do_request()

    Concurrency + temporal spacing (1 request every 2 seconds)::

        >>> rate_limited = Throttle(max_concurrent=1, min_interval=2.0)
        >>> async with rate_limited.slot():
        ...     return await do_request()

    One Throttle is shared and entered concurrently and repeatedly, so it is not
