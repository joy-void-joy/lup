"""Profiles a project keeps as directories of its own, one per account.

The second shape :mod:`lup.providers.profiles` names. A name is a directory
rather than an entry in a registry, so the configuration home that account
runs under — and whatever else it earns — sit together under
``<root>/<name>/``. Making the directory the origin is what keeps one name
meaning one account however it is spelled, to a launch or to a command tree
or to a setup wizard: there is no second list to register a profile in, and
so none to fall out of step with the profiles that exist.

Nothing here names a provider. Both the root and the subdirectory a
configuration home takes inside each profile are the caller's to choose, so
the same layout serves whichever runtime's homes a project keeps, and a
project keeping two runtimes' homes keeps them side by side under one name.
