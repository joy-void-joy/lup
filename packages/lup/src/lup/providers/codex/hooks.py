# lup: ignore[constant-declaration]
# Every constant here is a Codex app-server method or reply word, so the wire

# server never sends.
"""Translate backend-neutral Lup hooks to Codex app-server approval replies.

The Claude twin of this module wraps SDK hook handlers. Codex has no such
registry: the seam it offers is the approval request the app-server sends
*back* to whoever opened the thread, once that thread was started under a
policy that asks. So a portable hook becomes a reply to a server-initiated
request, and the transport in :mod:`lup.providers.codex.app_server` already
routes every such request to one installed handler.

What each boundary carries decides what can be judged there, and the two
approval requests are not alike:

``item/commandExecution/requestApproval``
    carries the command and its working directory, so a shell rule is judged
    on exactly the text about to run. This is parity with the Claude path.

``item/fileChange/requestApproval``
    carries an item id, a reason, and a root — and no file content at all. An
    edit rule reads before-and-after text, so there is nothing here for one to
    read. The request is therefore decoded as the opaque operation it is and
    answered by whatever the policy does with an unknown tool, which for every
    policy this library ships is a refusal. Approving it because the content
    could not be inspected would be the one reading that turns a missing
    capability into a silent grant.

That is also why the two sandbox facts split here. An approval reply accepts
or declines and rewrites nothing, so no verdict of this seam's places a call
and ``escapable`` stays false. The agent's own escape is a different matter
and it has one: Codex puts ``sandbox_permissions`` on the shell tool the
model calls — see :meth:`~lup.providers.codex.harness.CodexSpellings.escape_sandbox`
