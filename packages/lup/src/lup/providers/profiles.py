"""Where a project's named configuration homes come from, and the surface over them.

What a profile name means is the application's to decide: a personal registry
file listing accounts by hand, or a directory the project already keeps one
account per entry in. Two capabilities answer for such an origin, because
reading one and curating one are separate powers and most callers only ever
need the first — :class:`ProfileNames` says which names exist and what each
selects, :class:`ProfileRegistrar` registers, selects, and forgets them. Both
are engines; :class:`ProfileDirectory` is the concrete surface a command tree
and a launcher hold over whichever pair an application supplied. Both shapes
ship: :mod:`lup.providers.claude.profile_store` keeps the registry, and
:mod:`lup.providers.profile_tree` keeps the directories.

Nothing here names a provider. A directory carries the :class:`ProviderLogin`
of the runtime whose homes it holds, so reporting whether one is signed in —
and telling a caller how to sign it in — is answered in that runtime's own
words rather than in words this module would have to choose.
