"""Versioned evidence-backed runtime capability matrix.

The table describes capabilities supplied in ``SessionHandle`` and
``TurnHandle`` values. Unsupported capabilities are absent; diagnostics never
invoke operations and catch an unsupported-operation exception.

It sits beside the adapters rather than in an application because that is
what it is evidence *about*: each column is one native contract at the
version this library supports, so a release that moves an adapter moves the
row describing it. Held downstream instead, the matrix would keep describing
whichever SDK the adopter first vendored while the code beneath it changed.

Distinct from :mod:`lup.harness.evidence`, which records the CLI versions
installed on one machine to trigger the doctor's drift check. This records
what a contract can do; that records what is currently sitting on disk.
