"""Where a runtime keeps a stored login, and how to point it at one.

An application that spawns a provider CLI under a chosen account needs two
facts no other portable contract carries: the environment variable selecting a
configuration home, and the file the runtime writes a completed login into.
Both are words only the provider gets to choose, so each adapter declares its
own and every consumer above holds this value instead of spelling either.

The value is a transparent carrier — it composes no seam and decides nothing,
so an application stores one the way it stores the runtime's name.
