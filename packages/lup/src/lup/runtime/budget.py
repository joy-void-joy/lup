"""A spending ceiling that outlives the process holding it.

:class:`~lup.runtime.wrappers.BudgetConfig` caps one logical turn and raises
when the turn would exceed it. This caps a *period* — a rolling allowance such
as "so many dollars a day" — and, like :mod:`lup.runtime.quota`, waits rather
than failing: the run is long-lived and the money comes back when the window
rolls over, so stopping it would abandon work that only needed to be slower.

Two properties follow from the ceiling being an account's rather than a run's.
It is durable, because a run that crashes and restarts must not get a fresh
allowance; and it is shared, because several agents drawing on one account are
spending the same money. Both come from one small locked file the period's
spend is read and charged through, so concurrent processes serialize on it
rather than each keeping a private count.
