"""Private per-session configuration homes derived under a shared one.

A provider CLI reads its configuration document at startup and writes it
back, and nothing about that exchange is atomic. Sessions opened together
therefore read one another's partial writes: a run that leased eleven
concerns opened eleven sessions at once, six of them read a document another
was still writing, and every one died on a truncated parse before any work
began. Serializing the startup would only make them take turns rewriting a
file they all still share, so what is isolated here is the file.

A derived home is not a copy. Every entry it does not have to own is a
symlink back to the shared home, so a session keeps the settings, plugins,
and stored login the selected profile already carries — the login most of
all, since a refresh rotates the token and one copy of it going stale
invalidates the rest. Only the entries a runtime names unshareable are real
files in the derived home, and a runtime that names none shares everything.
