"""Selecting which runtime answers a session, as one value.

An application that names a runtime in more than one place can be changed in
only one of them: the sessions it opens would come from Codex while the login
its profile system administers still belonged to Claude. A :class:`Runtime`
is the whole selection — what a session opens through, and where that runtime
keeps a login — so an application holds one and names a provider nowhere.

:class:`SessionRequest` is a declaration, not a configuration. It says what a
caller wants of a session in words every runtime shares; each runtime renders
it into its own shape and states, in its own docstring, what it has no words
for. A field added here is a request every runtime then has to answer.
