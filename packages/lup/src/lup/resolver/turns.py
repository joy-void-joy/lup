"""Putting one prompt to one actor, and taking its typed submission back.

A worker revising its own code, a reviewer reading what that worker wrote,
and a merger settling a join are three spellings of one thing: address an
actor, hand it a prompt built from what the run knows, and receive a
submission. The differences that look structural are not — which factory
opens the session, which declared skill is rendered into the prompt, which
model the submission validates against.

What a prompt is built from is the other half of this. An actor is told what
the run has settled: the allowances its concern was granted, the answers a
human gave it, and — for a merger — the joins it has already made and what
the tree it is joining into is carrying. That last is why the merge ledger
lives here rather than with the phase that drives the joins: it is the
merger's memory across its own turns, and only the thing that takes those
turns can keep it.
