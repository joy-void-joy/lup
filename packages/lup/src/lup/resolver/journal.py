"""One ordered record of everything every actor in a run did.

A run's actors each hold their own session, and until now nothing outside
those sessions could see what happened inside one. The journal is that
record: one append-only file per run, one writer, every entry naming the
actor it belongs to.

Ordering needs no coordination. A run holds its state lock for its entire
life, so there is exactly one writer and the sequence number is simply the
count of what came before.

The per-actor view and the merged view are the same sequence, filtered or
not. That is deliberate — a merged view assembled from separate per-actor
logs would have to invent an ordering between them, and knowing what
actually happened first is the one thing a reader wants from a merged view.
