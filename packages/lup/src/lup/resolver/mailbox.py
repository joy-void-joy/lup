# lup: ignore[constant-declaration]
# The constants here name the mailbox's own on-disk layout, which a writer and
# a reader in different processes must agree on to find each other's files at
# all — an identity of this format rather than a choice a caller can make.
"""The persisted question mailbox every answer door writes through.

A question is a :class:`~lup.channels.slot.Slot`: declared once by whoever
asks, offered to by any door, and settled exactly once. Messages ride a
:class:`~lup.channels.stream.Stream` instead, and that split is the point.
A run parks while any *slot* it needs is unsettled; nothing parks on a
stream. So volunteering information to a worker cannot stall the run, which
it could when both rode the same structure.

Doors write ``offered``, which is correctable — a mistyped free-text answer
can be replaced right up until it counts, and an offer may arrive before its
question exists, which is what lets a flag answer a question the run has not
asked yet. Exactly one writer promotes offers into ``settled``, taking the
earliest valid one, so "first answer wins" is a deterministic decision
rather than a race between whoever reached the filesystem first.
