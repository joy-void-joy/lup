"""Answering whether a run is alive, and what it last did.

"Is it still running, or did it stop?" is the most common question about a
resolver run, because the resolver is built to be left alone: it parks,
persists, and is resumed later. The answer used to come from reading a
journal's mtime and hand-parsing its last event — a technique reinvented
each session and easy to get wrong in both directions, since a run can
legitimately print nothing for tens of minutes while a planner works.

Everything here is derived from the run directory alone. Under a sandbox
`/proc` is PID-isolated, so `ps` and `pgrep` list nothing outside the
current shell and a healthy run is indistinguishable from a dead one; a
liveness answer that consults the process table is therefore no answer at
all on the host the resolver most often runs on.

        ``running_yet`` is what keeps a watch from ending on the run it was

        for the seconds its interpreter takes to start there is no lock to
