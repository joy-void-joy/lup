"""The tools a resolver worker asks its material questions through.

A worker used to surface questions by ending its turn with them in its
typed report, which cost a whole new session to deliver the answer. These
tools let it ask mid-turn and keep working.

The handlers touch nothing but the mailbox and the lease they are bound to,
so one factory serves both transports: Claude registers the server
in-process, Codex spawns it as a stdio subprocess that rebuilds both from
the relayed context. Only where that context comes from differs.
