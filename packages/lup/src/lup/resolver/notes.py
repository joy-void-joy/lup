"""Clearance of a concern's own review notes from its leased worktree.

An editor is given a generalized spec, not the note that produced it, so the
notes it owns leave the lease before it ever runs. That is what makes the
edit policy's marker gate cost nothing here: the worker never changes a
marker count, because there is no marker of its own left to change.

Clearance is scoped by note identity rather than by file. A lease removes
only spans whose body is byte-identical to one of its own persisted notes,
so a sibling concern's note sharing the same file — or the same function —
survives. Losing a foreign note is a review finding, never a side effect of
clearing.
