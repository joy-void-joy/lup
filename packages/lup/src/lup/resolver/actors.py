"""One durable session per actor, opened once and kept while the run moves.

Every resolver turn used to go through :func:`lup.runtime.query.query`, which
opens a session, takes one turn and closes it. Nine separate symptoms sat
downstream of that one fact: a park discarded the whole turn, a reviewer
re-read its concern cold each round, a merger never saw the parent it joined
last, and the same question was answered four times because each turn
re-derived it under an id no recorded answer matched.

An actor here is addressed rather than constructed per turn. It holds its
session across every turn it takes, drains what it does into the journal as
it happens, and is reattached after a park from its persisted identity. The
multi-turn shape is not new — :class:`lup.runtime.background.BackgroundAgent`
already holds one session open across many turns — the resolver simply
reached for the one-shot convenience instead.

``query()`` stays in the library. It is the legitimate one-shot convenience
and ``examples/one_shot.py`` uses it; what changed is that no resolver turn
calls it.
