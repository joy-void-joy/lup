"""One join's files under a run directory, and the shapes written into them.

Separate from the verbs in :mod:`lup.resolver.join_tools` because the
readers are not the same set as the writers. The merger writes here through
the MCP tools; the status projection only reads, and answering "how far has
this join got" should not pull the tool layer, the orchestrator and an agent
transport in behind it.

The checkpoint is the reason the split earns its keep. It is written by
whoever landed the parent rather than by the orchestrator afterwards, so it
is current while a join turn is still running — which is exactly when
somebody is asking.
