"""Semantic permission policy that must decide identically in two homes.

The central concern: one canonical policy produces the same verdicts inside
this library (validated pydantic surfaces) and inside generated native plugin
dispatchers that run without lup installed. Every module placement follows
from that split:

- :mod:`lup.policy.kernel` — the hermetic decision core (shell, fetch, edit,
  anti-pattern scanning) over primitive rows, written against a pinned
  stdlib allowlist so it can be copied verbatim into generated runtimes.
- :mod:`lup.policy.models` — the typed semantic events and the
  allow/ask/deny ``Decision`` vocabulary.
- :mod:`lup.policy.contracts` — the ``DecisionPolicy``/``Observer`` seams.
- :mod:`lup.policy.native` — the decode/render seams a native adapter
  implements at its wire boundary.
- :mod:`lup.policy.rules` — validated pydantic policies that erase their
  inputs into kernel rows and delegate every verdict to the kernel.
- :mod:`lup.policy.chain` — deny-before-ask composition and observer
  dispatch that can never weaken a verdict.
- :mod:`lup.policy.bundle` — assembly for generation: reads the kernel
  source verbatim and renders application-owned data rows as generated
  files; the adapters' hook renderers consume it.

The kernel imports nothing outside its allowlist and no other module here;
``rules`` and ``chain`` build the library layer on kernel plus models; only
``bundle`` is about generating files rather than deciding.
