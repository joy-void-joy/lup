"""A shell vocabulary an adopter starts from, offered as groups to compose.

:mod:`lup.policy.shell_rules` declares the *shape* a vocabulary takes and
says the words themselves are a judgement about one project's toolchain, so
they arrive from outside. That is true, and it left the library shipping
nothing — which is not the neutral position it reads as. An empty table
matches no command, every command is then unjudged, and unjudged resolves to
a deny: a fresh adopter's agent cannot run ``ls`` until several hundred lines
of vocabulary exist. Shipping nothing chose a verdict for them just as surely
as shipping something would have, and chose the least useful one.

So each group below is a function returning rules, and every word it declares
is a parameter default rather than a table. An adopter calls the group to
take the judgement as offered, passes their own words to replace it, or
splices extra rules around it::

    SHELL_RULES = [
        *read_only_rules(),
        *judged_ask_rules(),
        *guarded_tool_rules(),
        git_rule(guard_force_push=False, redirect_checkout=True),
        gh_rule(),
        docker_rule(),
        my_own_cli_rule(),
    ]

The judgement running through all of it: generous for reading and for local
work a second attempt undoes, conservative for anything that loses something.
Networked is deliberately not the line — publishing is how work becomes
reviewable and happens many times a session, so ``git push`` and the pull
request verbs that open and describe one are ordinary. What stays guarded is
the direction that removes something no second attempt restores.

Where a group's default encodes a judgement a reasonable project would make
differently, it takes a parameter instead of a fork: whether a force push is
guarded, whether ``checkout`` is redirected toward ``switch``/``restore``,
whether opening a pull request is authoring or publishing.

    A checker reads the tree and writes inside it, so it runs wherever the
    session runs and takes ``ambient``.

    A toolchain that opens agent sessions cannot. The runtime keeps
    per-session state under its own configuration directory — for Claude Code,
    ``~/.claude/session-env/<session id>``, following ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` —
    and a session opened from inside a sandbox that does not grant that path
    dies on its first shell call with a bare ``EROFS``, which reads to an agent
    like a broken repository rather than like a boundary. It then retries,
    works around it, or reports success from a session that never ran a
    command; one planning run finished that way and looked normal.

    The deny is the runtime protecting its own configuration directory, and a
    grant does not lift it. A live session's filesystem policy shows the shape:
    the repository root sits in ``allowOnly`` while the configuration home
    below it — ``session-env`` and its neighbours — is listed again under
    ``denyWithinAllow``, a carve-out applied within the grant. The runtime
    enumerates that directory itself, so the entries appear whether or not a
    project declares them. Nor would lifting it be the
    remedy: the runtime chooses that path per session, so the grant is a family
    rather than a path; deriving a private configuration home does not move it,
    because every entry such a home does not own links back to the shared one;
    and session state is only the first thing such a
    toolchain writes outside the tree — a worktree, a plugin cache, and the
    git configuration behind them follow it.

    Which is why the escape is declared here, once, on the toolchain itself,
    rather than left to each caller to remember. Where a runtime places no
    single call outside its sandbox, a confined session is stopped with that
    reason instead — see :func:`~lup.policy.kernel.shell.decide_shell`.

    """Compile the git surface: reads and reversible work allow, losses ask.

    Two judgements a project can reasonably differ on are parameters rather
    than a reason to fork the table.

    ``guard_force_push`` decides whether replacing what a remote ref points
    at is worth a question. It usually is. A project whose review flow
    rebases and republishes a branch every round answers no, because there
    the force is the ordinary case and the ask lands on nearly every push.
    What removes a ref outright stays guarded either way: no second push
    restores it.

    ``redirect_checkout`` decides how ``git checkout`` is met. Off, it asks —
    the branch-switching form is harmless, but ``checkout -- <path>``
    discards work. On, it denies and names ``switch`` and ``restore``
    instead, which suits a project that has settled on the newer verbs. The
    ref-sourced ``checkout <ref> -- <path>`` form is recognized by the kernel
    ahead of this row either way, because committed content stays
    recoverable.

    ``sandbox`` is where git runs, stated once here and inherited by every
    subcommand. It is the other axis rather than another effect: a fetch
    confined to a sandbox with no route to the remote fails however freely it
    was allowed, and a worktree or config write confined away from the
    repository's own locks fails the same way, so the placement follows the
    tool rather than a list of its verbs. A project whose sandbox does reach
    its remotes answers ``escalable`` instead, which keeps the ordinary fetch
    confined and leaves the way out to the agent that finds it needs one.

    """Compile the gh surface: reads allow, judged mutations ask, else deny.

    ``allow_authoring`` decides whether opening a pull request, retitling it,
    and marking it ready are the author describing their own work or a
    publication worth a question. On, they allow — a review flow does all
    three every round, and the branch is already pushed by then. Off, they
    join the verbs that reach other people. Commenting, reviewing, merging
    and closing ask either way: those reach reviewers, or change what the
    repository is.

    Both halves of that grant are claims about *this* repository — the work is
    the author's own, and the branch is already pushed — and ``--repo`` is what
    makes them someone else's, so the authoring verbs carry it as a guard the
    way git's redirecting globals do. Spelled as a flag, the redirect is judged
    per verb, so reading another repository keeps its grant: a read is a read
    wherever it points.

    The flag is only half of it. ``GH_REPO`` and ``GH_HOST`` reach the same
    retarget through the environment, and that spelling is caught by the
    dangerous-assignment prefixes in :mod:`lup.policy.kernel.words` rather than
    here — a guard that reads the assignment before any verb is known, so
    unlike the flag it stops a redirected read as well. The asymmetry is the
    price of catching the variable gh has not learned yet.

    `eval` *subcommand* that no flag list could have caught.
