"""A shell vocabulary an adopter starts from, offered as groups to compose.

:mod:`lup.policy.shell_rules` declares the *shape* a vocabulary takes and
says the words themselves are a judgement about one project's toolchain, so
they arrive from outside. That is true, and it left the library shipping
nothing — which is not the neutral position it reads as. An empty table
matches no command, every command is then unjudged, and unjudged resolves to
a deny: a fresh adopter's agent cannot run ``ls`` until several hundred lines
of vocabulary exist. Shipping nothing chose a verdict for them just as surely
as shipping something would have, and chose the least useful one.

So each group below is a function returning rules, and every word it declares
is a parameter default rather than a table. An adopter calls the group to
take the judgement as offered, passes their own words to replace it, or
splices extra rules around it::

    SHELL_RULES = [
        *read_only_rules(),
        *judged_ask_rules(),
        *guarded_tool_rules(),
        git_rule(guard_force_push=False, redirect_checkout=True),
        gh_rule(),
        docker_rule(),
        my_own_cli_rule(),
    ]

The judgement running through all of it: generous for reading and for local
work a second attempt undoes, conservative for anything that loses something.
Networked is deliberately not the line — publishing is how work becomes
reviewable and happens many times a session, so ``git push`` and the pull
request verbs that open and describe one are ordinary. What stays guarded is
the direction that removes something no second attempt restores.

Where a group's default encodes a judgement a reasonable project would make
differently, it takes a parameter instead of a fork: whether a force push is
guarded, whether ``checkout`` is redirected toward ``switch``/``restore``,
whether opening a pull request is authoring or publishing.

    A checker reads the tree and writes inside it, so it runs wherever the
    session runs and takes ``ambient``.

    A toolchain that opens agent sessions cannot. The runtime keeps
    per-session state under its own configuration directory — for Claude Code,
    ``~/.claude/session-env/<session id>``, following ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` —
    and a session opened from inside a sandbox that does not grant that path
    dies on its first shell call with a bare ``EROFS``, which reads to an agent
    like a broken repository rather than like a boundary. It then retries,
    works around it, or reports success from a session that never ran a
    command; one planning run finished that way and looked normal.

    Measured rather than assumed, because the deny looks like the runtime
    protecting its own configuration directory: under one ``~/.claude`` parent,
    ``debug`` — a path the sandbox grants — accepts a directory, while
    ``session-env`` and a per-session configuration directory beside it, which
    it does not grant, both refuse one with ``EROFS``. So the deny is the
    ordinary write allowlist and a grant would lift it. It is still not the
    remedy: the runtime chooses that path per session, so the grant is a family
    rather than a path; deriving a private configuration home does not move it,
    because every entry such a home does not own links back to the shared one;
    and session state is only the first thing such a
    toolchain writes outside the tree — a worktree, a plugin cache, and the
    git configuration behind them follow it.

    Which is why the escape is declared here, once, on the toolchain itself,
    rather than left to each caller to remember. Where a runtime places no
    single call outside its sandbox, a confined session is stopped with that
    reason instead — see :func:`~lup.policy.kernel.shell.decide_shell`.

    Two judgements a project can reasonably differ on are parameters rather

    at is worth a question. It usually is. A project whose review flow
    rebases and republishes a branch every round answers no, because there
    the force is the ordinary case and the ask lands on nearly every push.
    What removes a ref outright stays guarded either way: no second push
    restores it.

    ``redirect_checkout`` decides how ``git checkout`` is met. Off, it asks —
    the branch-switching form is harmless, but ``checkout -- <path>``
    discards work. On, it denies and names ``switch`` and ``restore``
    instead, which suits a project that has settled on the newer verbs. The
    ref-sourced ``checkout <ref> -- <path>`` form is recognized by the kernel
    ahead of this row either way, because committed content stays
    recoverable.

    ``remote_subcommands`` are the verbs that open a transport, and
