"""The shape a shell vocabulary takes, and its erasure into kernel rows.

The hermetic kernel classifies one shell command by consulting primitive rows,
exactly as it consults URL scopes and protected-path rows: the control flow
lives in :mod:`lup.policy.kernel`, and the *vocabulary* — which tools are safe
to run unattended, which forms need a human — is a judgement about one
project's toolchain, so it arrives from outside. This module declares the
shape that judgement takes as a nested pydantic table a human can read and
extend, and :func:`erase_shell_rules` flattens it into the ``ShellRuleRow``
tuples the kernel interprets.

An application declares its own table and hands it to ``ShellPolicy`` and to
``HookSet.shell_rules``; :mod:`lup.policy.bundle` erases that same table into
``policy_data.py`` at generation time, so the canonical ``ShellPolicy`` and
every generated dispatcher decide identically. This repository's table is
``lup_template.devtools.harness.content.shell_vocabulary``.

Three nesting levels mirror how real tools are shaped:

* a bare command — ``ls``, ``sort`` — declares ``default_effect="allow"``,
  optionally with ``ask_flags`` that turn a reader into a writer (``sort -o``,
  ``find -delete``);
* a subcommand command — ``git``, ``gh`` — declares ``default_effect="deny"``
  (an unjudged subcommand bounces back to the agent) and lists the subcommands
  it has judged (``git status`` allows, ``git push`` asks); its ``value_flags``
  skip value-taking globals (``git -C <path>``) so the value is never read as
  the subcommand, and its ``ask_flags`` guard dangerous globals (``git -c``);
* a subcommand whose *operation* word decides safety — ``git worktree add`` is
  reversible, ``git worktree remove`` is not — carries ``operations``.

Both axes cascade down that nesting, and absence has exactly one meaning
everywhere: a level that omits ``effect`` or ``sandbox`` inherits the value
from the level above it, and a level that states one overrides what it
inherited in either direction — widening a restrictive parent is as ordinary
as narrowing a permissive one. So ``git`` says once where its subcommands run,
and each of them says only what differs.

Absence is distinguished from a stated value of the same word by what pydantic
already records about which fields a declaration supplied, so no field is
retyped as optional to carry the distinction. The one field with no such
escape is ``ShellCommandRule.default_effect``, which is required: who decides
has no member meaning "no opinion", so a command that forgot to say is a gap a
reader should see rather than a value it silently inherited. ``ROOT_EFFECT``
is what would be inherited beneath every table, spelled restrictively for the
same reason.
