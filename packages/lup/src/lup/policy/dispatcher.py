# lup: ignore[model-free-function, constant-declaration]
# Every constant here is a name in the script this module emits — its package,
# its members, its router, its entry point, its shebang. They are the compiled
# artifact's own vocabulary, so a caller passing different ones would be
# compiling a different artifact than the one the proofs below read.
# The compiler is the renderer half of declaration-plus-renderer, and its proofs
# span the halves it joins: a declaration that compiled itself would carry the
# reading of source it is checked against, and no single half can say whether
# the one script they become still resolves. What a half can say about itself
# is a method on SourceHalf.
"""Compile one hook dispatcher per native runtime from type-checked source.

A dispatcher is the one artifact whose breakage is silent: a plugin host runs
it outside the workspace, so an unresolved name or a missing branch surfaces
as a permission decision that never happens, in a session that only sees the
tool go through. Shipping it as text would put the most safety-critical file
in the repository beyond every checker and leave each runtime holding its own
copy of the host-side half, so it is compiled instead — from
:mod:`lup.policy.assets.host`, which every runtime answers identically, plus
one :class:`DispatcherDeclaration` per runtime stating what genuinely differs.

Every field of that declaration is required, so a new axis — another routed
tool, another hook event, another failure shape — becomes a field no runtime
can be constructed without answering, the way a new prompt part becomes a
method no :class:`~lup.harness.contracts.NativeSpellings` can omit. Divergence
is a construction error rather than something a reviewer has to notice.

Compilation reads modules the workspace already type-checks and lints, selects
declared members from their syntax trees, and emits their exact source. It
never authors logic, so nothing reaches a generated script that pyright has
not read, and a traceback in a hook keeps the text a reviewer is looking at.
What the compiler owns is proof: that the script imports only what a bare
script beside its runtime can resolve, that neither half repeats the other,
and that the tools routed, events named, environment read, and failure taken
are the ones the declaration promised.
