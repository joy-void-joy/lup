"""Every command form a shell vocabulary declares, and how each is decided.

A vocabulary is a table of judgements about one project's toolchain, and its
shape changes more often than those judgements do. Reasoning about the rules is
what produces a reshaping that looks harmless and moves a verdict three levels
down, so the check offered here is mechanical instead: enumerate every form the
table declares, classify each through the same kernel a session consults, and
compare the answers against the ones the table gave before.

A downstream project wants exactly this whenever it edits its own composition,
which is why the walk is library mechanism rather than one repository's test.
