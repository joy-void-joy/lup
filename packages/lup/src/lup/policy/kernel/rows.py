    ``subcommand`` and ``operation`` are ``""`` at the levels a rule does not

    named flags appears among the command's remaining words. On the
    command-level row of a subcommand-gated command, ``ask_flags`` guard the
    global options before the subcommand and ``value_flags`` name globals that
    consume the following word (``git -C <path>``), so a flag value is never
    read as the subcommand. ``allow_flags`` name a pure read-only form of a
    non-allow row (``ssh-add -l``): the row de-escalates to allow only when
    every remaining word is exactly one of the named flags, so clusters,
    ``=`` values, paths, and unresolved expansions never qualify.
    ``read_verbs`` name action-selecting flags of a command that enforces one
    action at a time (``git config --get``): a non-allow row de-escalates to
    allow when a declared verb appears among words that are all literal and
    free of guarded flags, because the verb pins the invocation to its query
    action regardless of the other words.

    ``sandbox`` says where this command has to run, independently of who
    decides it: a verb that reaches a remote is unusable confined however the
    effect reads, and a verb whose blast radius wants the OS boundary keeps it
    however ordinary the effect reads.
