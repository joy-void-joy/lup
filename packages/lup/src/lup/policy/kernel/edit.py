# lup: Editing `.claude/` or `.codex/` should be auto-deny here, carrying the

# is judged by the ordinary lattice.
#
# lup: The edit gate should refuse a *spurious* suppression — an added
# `ignore[rule]` on a line that does not trip that rule. It asks about every
# added directive equally, so the cheap way past a gate is a marker that
# suppresses nothing, and the audit only reports it later. The refiner already
# decides exemption per line, which is the same question.
#
# lup: It should be possible to *relocate* a note. The gate reads any edit that
# drops the marker line as a deletion, so moving one to the declaration it
# actually concerns is refused with "resolving a note means replacing it with
# solved" — which is not what a move is. This bites hardest in a merge, where
# both sides add at one spot and a note routinely lands against the wrong
# declaration. Recognize a marker whose text reappears elsewhere in the file.
#
# lup: It is also hard to tell whether a new file the agent writes carries any
# suppression directives at all. I like reviewing the full Write, so I get the
# gist of the folder hierarchy and so on — surface the ignores a creation
# introduces rather than letting the full-write gate wave the file through.

    The two marker families are gated in opposite directions. Feedback is
    judged by :func:`marker_decision`: adding it asks, deleting it is denied,
    and the way through is to convert a note into a claim the review pass can
    check. A suppression is gated where it is declared — an added line

    re-reads the uncovered line, allows it where nothing trips, and denies
    where the violation is still live. What makes that verdict trustworthy is
    :func:`refined_exempt_lines`, without which a rule broader than the defect
    it names holds its own suppression in place forever.

    Each gate reaches as far as its own reason. Anti-patterns, the size gate
