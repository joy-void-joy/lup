"""The seam that turns a policy verdict into a live session's refusal.

The policies in :mod:`lup.policy.rules` answer with a
:class:`~lup.policy.models.Decision`; a session refuses through the portable
hooks of :mod:`lup.hooks`. The mapping between them is not a choice a caller
should make twice — ``ask`` must reach a human and ``defer`` must reach
nobody, and a composition that guesses either one wrong turns a gate into a
silent grant. So it is decided here, once, and pinned by tests.

Generated plugins enforce the same policies from a subprocess dispatcher
assembled by :mod:`lup.policy.bundle`. This is the in-process counterpart:
same policies, same verdicts, delivered through the hook seam a session
already carries.

    verdict maps to — so a denied call never runs and an ``ask`` reaches a
    human instead of the model.

    **When:** Use for a session composed in this process. Generated native
    plugins enforce the same policies from their own dispatcher; this is
    for the session an application builds and runs itself.

    **Why:** A verdict a caller only prints is documentation. Registered
    here it is the session's answer, produced by the same policy objects
    the generated dispatchers erase into rows.

    **Why scoped:** the routed set carried by *semantics* is what keeps this
    the same enforcement the plugin performs rather than a stricter one.
    Unregistered elsewhere, this hook sees every call, and a tool with no
    rule surface reaches :class:`UnknownToolPolicy`, whose conservative
    ``ask`` then outranks an ``allow`` a directory ACL beside it already

            policy has rules for, as the adapter exports them.
        sandbox: What the configuration this session is opened with confines
            and permits. Left unstated, no placement reaches the wire, which
            is the right answer for a session that declared no sandbox and
