"""Library-side validated policies that erase into kernel rows to decide.

Each policy (shell, fetch, edit) validates its configuration as pydantic
surfaces — URL scopes, path rules, the canonical anti-pattern set — then
flattens them into primitive rows and delegates every verdict to
:mod:`lup.policy.kernel`. :mod:`lup.policy.bundle` performs the same erasure
at generation time, which is how this layer and the generated dispatchers
stay decision-identical; the shared fixture suite asserts exactly that.
