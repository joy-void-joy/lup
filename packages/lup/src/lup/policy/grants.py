"""The gates a lease holds, written where a judgment can read them back.

An identity is settled before a session starts and stays true for as long as
it runs, so the environment carries it. A grant is not like that: a worker
discovers mid-flight that it needs a gate, asks, and a human answers while
the session that asked is already running. Rendered into the environment the
answer had nowhere to land — the only channel for it belonged to a process
that had already started — so the ask and the grant were separated by a
restart nobody planned for.

So the grant lives in a document, and the environment carries only where that
document is. The reader is a hook: a separate process the runtime launches
before a tool call, whose kernel is compiled into both plugin trees and must
not learn what a resolver or a concern is. It can read a file, which is all
this asks of it. One document per lease is what makes a grant answer for the
lease it was made for and no other; reading it at judgment rather than at
launch is what makes an answer that arrives mid-lease arrive at all.

Both directions govern. A name removed from the document stops releasing its
gate at the next judgment, because the document is read then and not before —
which is what lets a grant made in error be retracted while it still matters.
Whoever composes the session decides what a narrowing means:
:class:`LeaseGrants` reads and answers, and a composition that wants a
withdrawal to be loud rather than silent says so by supplying its own.
