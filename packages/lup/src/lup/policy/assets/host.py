"""The host-side half every generated hook dispatcher answers identically.

The kernel decides from primitive rows alone: it never reads the filesystem
and never reads the environment. Everything a decision needs from the host —
whether the sandbox confines this session, which write targets already exist,
what the launcher declared about the agent — is resolved here and passed in,
which keeps the decision itself a pure function of its inputs.

No runtime spells any of this differently, so :mod:`lup.policy.dispatcher`
compiles this module into both generated scripts from this one source and
each dispatcher keeps only its own words. Nothing here may reach the kernel,
the ``lup`` package, or anything outside the dispatcher's pinned standard
library: the compiled script runs as a bare script, promised no working
directory, ``PYTHONPATH``, or interpreter environment. What varies by runtime
arrives as an argument — the managed root to enumerate, the environment
variable to read — never as a branch on which runtime is asking.
