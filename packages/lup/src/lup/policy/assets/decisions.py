"""The decisions every runtime reaches identically, over the shared kernel.

:mod:`lup.policy.dispatcher` compiles this half into every generated script
beside the host half and one runtime's own words, so a decision written here
is the decision every runtime makes. What belongs here is everything
downstream of a payload: the declarations a tool is judged against, and the
host-resolved facts the kernel needs to judge it. What does not belong is
anything a runtime spells for itself — the payload shape those values are read
out of, the root it installs trusted packages beneath, and the envelope a
verdict is returned in.

The split is drawn there because the arguments a kernel call carries are
exactly what drifted before. Each runtime passed its own set, nothing compared
them, and a fact one of them stopped passing was a rule that silently stopped
applying — with no failure anywhere, because a permission that never happens
looks like a permission that was granted. One call site cannot disagree with
itself.

The imports below resolve against the generated runtime this is compiled
beside, which is why this file is type-checked against that tree rather than
against the workspace.

    The kernel reads no filesystem, so every fact about the paths this command

    are directories.

    Existence and recoverability both cover redirection targets and path-verb
    operands alike, because the questions they ask are the same ones —
    whether writing here brings something into being or replaces it, and what
    replacing it would cost. Resolving them for only one of the two writing
    forms is what left ``rm f`` granted while ``echo x > f`` asked about the
    same clean, tracked file.

    ``escapable`` is the one thing here a runtime answers rather than the host:
    whether it can put a single call outside its own sandbox. It arrives as an
    argument for the same reason the rest does — a fact one dispatcher stopped
    passing is a rule that silently stopped applying.
