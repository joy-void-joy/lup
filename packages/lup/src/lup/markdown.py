"""The cells a generated Markdown table is laid out from.

Prose written by a human is Markdown all the way down and needs nothing here.
What needs a renderer is a table *derived* from declarations: a pipe or a
newline in a value silently breaks the row it lands in, and the layout is the
same every time it is written by hand.

A cell holds the literal value it stands for and escapes that value as it
renders, so there is no way to put text in a table that does not survive being
there. What the kinds below differ on is the formatting the author meant
around the value — plain, code, a link — never whether the value inside stays
literal. The table itself is :class:`lup.harness.models.MarkdownTable`, a
prompt part like any other, which lays these out without looking inside them.

    # shared declarations. That DRY reversal was chosen deliberately, against the

    # exempt, and delete the aliases rather than leaving them unreferenced.
