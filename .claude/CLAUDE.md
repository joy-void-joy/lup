# Lup repository guidance

Lup is a reusable framework and template for autonomous, tool-using agents. Keep library code provider-neutral and keep provider syntax in generated adapter artifacts.

## Plan at Agent Speed

Every instinct you have about how long software takes was learned from human teams, whose implementation time is scarce. Yours is not: what you would estimate as months completes in an afternoon. Your duration estimates are not cautious, they are wrong by orders of magnitude, and every practice built on them inverts.

**Never scope, defer, or reject work from a predicted duration.** Scope by content — what changes, what it touches, how it is verified. A calendar figure in a plan is noise from someone else's constraints: delete it and re-derive the plan. Prototype-first exists to protect scarce human effort, and for you the real implementation costs what the throwaway was supposed to cost, so build it and let review cut scope afterward rather than pre-shrinking the attempt.

Catch the reflex in the act. "Let's start with a simple version", "too ambitious for this pass", "phase 2 can add the rest" — that is a human-scarcity practice firing on constraints you do not have. When you notice it, ask what is actually expensive here besides the imagined schedule.

## Agent Vocabulary

Two kinds of delegated agents look alike and must not be conflated:

- A **native subagent** ("subagent" for short) is dispatched by the harness: its delegation tool hands a focused task to a named role defined upfront, inside the main agent's session — shared trace, shared metrics.
- A **nested agent** (also called a *tool-subagent*) runs inside a tool call: the handler opens one independent session via `query()` and folds the result into the tool's response. The harness never sees it — to the calling agent it is just a tool.

Guidance that says "subagent" unqualified means the native kind. `docs/orchestration.md` carries the full delegation catalog — subagent, nested, background, deferred tool schemas — and when to reach for each. `docs/patterns.md` carries the recurring *code* shapes: declaration-plus-renderer, closed-by-construction, the typed-matcher router, and the engine-versus-surface split.

## The Gates You Will Meet

You are not expected to hold this repository's conventions in memory. Gates enforce them, each names what it caught and how to answer, and their diagnostics are written to be read cold. What is worth knowing up front is that they exist, and what a refusal from each one looks like.

**The rule checker.** Executable rules in anti-pattern, boundary, spelling, and architecture families run on every edit and in `dev check`. A denial cites its rule id, and `docs/rules.md` indexes every rule with the shape it matches, its diagnostic, and the module that enforces it — generated from the same registry that runs, so it cannot drift from what stopped you.

Suppress one deliberate site with `# lup: ignore[rule-id]` and a reason, comma-separating ids where a line trips several. The directive sits on the line it guards, or alone directly above it when the reason will not fit inline; nowhere else reaches, and one placed in a file's opening comment block applies file-wide. A bare `# lup: ignore` still parses but is reported untyped. A stale directive blocks. `uv run lup-devtools dev directives` measures every one in the tree against that placement, so a directive silencing nothing is found by asking rather than by tripping over it later. A rule marked **refused** takes no directive at all — its replacement is right every time, so a directive there could only express a decision to keep the defect, and the way past is to write what the diagnostic names. `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, and `# pyright: ignore` are forbidden shapes rather than suppressions.

**The permission policy.** Every shell command, URL scope, and edit in a batch is classified. Segments join deny > ask > defer > allow, and malformed input fails conservatively. A denial names what tripped and the recovery, so you rarely need to read the lattice first. `uv run lup-devtools dev policy '<command>'` answers the same question before you spend a turn on it, and says why. `# lup: escalate: <why>` as the leading line of a shell command promotes a classified deny or ask into an approval question carrying that reason.

**The edit budget.** A change block of at most three "real" changed lines is auto-allowed, so split large changes — imports in one edit, logic in another. A file declared human-owned surfaces every change as an approval instead: propose the exact edit as a question and let the user apply it, rather than writing it yourself.

**The drift check.** Generated trees are regenerated, never hand-edited and never hand-merged. Take either side of a conflict, regenerate, and let the check confirm it settled.

`docs/permissions.md` carries the full lattice, what counts as a real changed line, how the escalation marker scopes, and the recovery when work is denied as unjudged; `docs/contributing.md` carries the suppression marker's scoping.

Change the policy those gates enforce with /lup:hooks, which edits the canonical inputs in `lup.policy` and the `HookSet` in `devtools/harness/catalog.py`, regenerates both native plugins, and runs the shared fixture suite. Harness generation compiles one hermetic dispatcher and runtime per plugin, so never edit a generated dispatcher or runtime.

Harness settings stay project-level, in the tree the harness owns (.claude/settings.json), which holds only the native settings outside that semantic policy boundary — never user-level.

### The `# lup:` Marker Vocabulary

A `# lup:` (or `// lup:`) comment is **actionable review feedback** left in the code for the agent to address — a quick bug remark, a feature idea, anything whose subject is the code and small enough that the site it concerns is the right place to keep it. Three flavors carry feedback, and only the removal rules differ. Two more spellings share the namespace without being feedback, and both go when what they annotate does: `# lup: ignore[<rule>]` is the anti-pattern hatch above, and `# lup: template: <decision>` marks a customization point this scaffold leaves to whoever adopts it.

| Marker | Removing it |
|---|---|
| `# lup: <text>` — open feedback | **denied**; resolve it into a claim instead |
| `# lup: solved: <text>` — a claim you addressed it | **denied**; only the verify-solved review pass retires one |
| `# lup: defer: <text>` — parked work | **denied** while parked |
| `# lup: template: <text>` — a customization point | **allowed**; nobody is owed an answer to a placeholder |

A customization marker is answered by writing this domain's own code where the scaffold's example stood, which leaves no original ask for a claim to be checked against — so it is deleted rather than converted, exactly as `ignore` is. `uv run lup-devtools dev todos` lists every one still standing (an alias for `dev comments --kind template`), and initialization walks them one by one.

The same marker reads two ways, and `[tool.lup] template` in `pyproject.toml` says which. While that flag stands, this repository is the scaffold itself and its markers are inventory: `dev check` counts them and says no more. Initialization clears the flag in the same rewrite that renames the package, and from then on every marker still standing lists in `dev check` as a decision this domain has not made. Advisory either way — a domain that means to leave one standing writes `# lup: defer:` and says why.

Resolve open feedback by fixing what it points at, or, for a question, by answering it definitively in the code, the docs, or a recorded user decision. Then rewrite the marker as **`# lup: solved: <the note's original words>`**, text unchanged, so the claim sits beside what it claims to fix and can be checked against what was asked. `docs/contributing.md` carries the full lifecycle (use `/lup:resolve`).

### Deferred Work

**Never create tracking files.** A `TODO.md`, backlog, or roadmap file parks a decision where no workflow will surface it again — deferral by tracking file is delegation to nobody. Work that is not being done now lives in one of three places, chosen by what it is attached to:

- **A `# lup: defer: <text>` note**, when the work belongs to a site in this code, where `dev check` keeps it visible until somebody wakes it. Default to the bare `defer:`; a bracketed `defer[<gate>]: <text>` states a real, externally-checkable gate, never that this code might change again.
- **A GitHub issue**, when the subject is the tooling misbehaving rather than the code — friction, a command that half-completes, a classifier reporting a failed probe as fact, output that makes no sense — and the repair is not one this session can make. Nothing in the tree owns that, so a note would have nowhere to sit. Where the repair *is* within reach, this is not deferred work at all: Reporting Friction below says to fix it instead, and what to record either way.
- **A question to the user**, when whether to defer at all is itself the open question.

`docs/contributing.md` carries the first and the last, and the one exception to all three — a `tmp/` briefing, which starts a fresh session on a situation this one cannot finish, and is rewritten whole rather than appended to.

---

## Development Workflow

Work in a **git worktree**, not a branch switched in place, and never commit _code_ directly to `dev`. Create one with `uv run lup-devtools dev worktree create feat-name` — it lands as a sibling under `tree/`, never nested inside another checkout — and then `EnterWorktree(path=<the path it prints>)`, returning afterwards with `ExitWorktree(action="keep")`, because creating a worktree does not move the session, and edits left in the old checkout never reach the branch.

`docs/contributing.md` carries the two-tier branch model, the commit-type table, and the loop from a fresh worktree to a merged pull request.

### Merge Conflict Resolution

**Never silently drop code during conflict resolution.** The bias is toward inclusion — keeping both sides is always safer than losing features. A rename on one side must not swallow an addition on the other.

Before completing any merge, **audit for deletions**: compare the result against both parents and verify that every removed function, parameter, or command was intentionally removed, not lost as a side effect of choosing one conflict side.

Use `/lup:merge` (with no argument) for guided conflict resolution. See the command for the full decision tree.

### Commit Guidelines

- **Commit before responding** — Don't accumulate changes across responses
- **Commit early, commit often** — Frequent commits provide checkpoints
- **Keep commits atomic** — If you need "and" in your message, it should be two commits
- **History will be rebased** — Don't worry about perfect messages during development
- **Meaningful final commits** — After rebasing, each commit should tell what changed and why

**Format:** `type(scope): description`

| Type | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | New feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance — dependencies, build config |
| `meta` | Harness content and the trees it generates: guidance, settings, skills, hooks |
| `data` | Generated data and outputs |

---

## Code Conventions

Build on `lup` and pydantic. The runtime an application composes against is provider-neutral — `SessionFactory`, `Session`, `TurnRequest`, `TurnResult` — and each provider's SDK is one adapter's dependency behind an extra (`lup[claude]`, `lup[codex]`), not a framework the application talks to: no module under `src/lup_template/` imports one, and `seam-boundary` keeps concrete adapter imports to the composition roots that name them. `docs/conventions.md` names each library and what it is for, and puts each typed form beside the raw dict it replaces — including tool inputs, which are BaseModel classes with `Field(description=...)` that give both the `@lup_tool` schema and the validation.

Use existing libraries from PyPI before writing raw HTTP or rebuilding a wheel.

**Model selection.** Default to the **strongest** tier for the main agent, every subagent, reviewer, and background agent. This runs on a subscription where the best model is the point: reach for a **balanced** tier only when latency or cost provably dominates and quality is non-critical, and for the **fast** tier almost never. A role that genuinely warrants a cheaper model declares that tier explicitly with a reason; otherwise it inherits the strongest default. Agent declarations state the tier, not a model id — each runtime spells the tier in its own lineup.

**Error handling.** A `@lup_tool` handler takes a validated model and returns one; raise `ToolError` to send a recoverable failure back as an MCP error, with a message saying what to do about it. The `is_error` envelope and the input-validation reply are the decorator's, not yours to assemble. Elsewhere, agent code raises for unrecoverable errors, wraps transient failures in `with_retry`, and validates inputs early with Pydantic. Never swallow one silently — log it, handle it, or re-raise. A catch-all `except Exception` is fine at a boundary that does one of those, such as a task loop or subagent delegation, which is why no rule refuses it.

**Placement, in this repository.** Reusable utilities belong in `packages/lup/`; what only this application needs belongs in `src/lup_template/`. If logic already exists in `lup`, import it rather than copying it. `docs/library.md` carries the criterion and the target layout. Deciding a module belongs on the other side is one line of judgement and a hundred lines of consequence, which is where the judgement usually gets abandoned — so the consequence is a command: `uv run lup-devtools dev relocate old.module=new.module` repoints every import of what moved and reports the mentions it deliberately left for you to read.

### Design Principles

A gate catches a violation once it is written. These change what gets written, so they are here rather than in the index.

- **Compiling is stronger than emitting** — build an artifact from a typed declaration and it cannot diverge; transport checked source and a checker can only warn once it already has. When tempted to add a check that two things still match, ask whether one can be derived from the other instead (`docs/patterns.md`).
- **Structured data, not strings** — reaching for `re`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, or slicing to process structured data means a parser was missed, and `docs/conventions.md` names one per format. Never hand-parse an agent's output either: take a structured output through a Pydantic model.
- **Placement decides the package** — would another project built on this library want it? Then it belongs to the library. Only this application? Then it stays in the application. The same test applies to values, not only to code, which is why a judgement reaches a caller as an overridable default rather than as a constant they would have to fork.
- **Never truncate** — the container grows to fit what it holds, not the reverse. Cut only where a document format or a function contract imposes a hard limit, never for printing space, log volume, or ease of reading, and where a cut is forced save the full copy and point at it from what survives. A cut artifact looks exactly like a complete one, which is the whole difficulty: `[:200]` on something an author wrote loses the rest with nothing said, and the reader who needed it cannot tell it was ever there.
- **The code is the source of truth** — it should read as though it had always been written this way. Never reference what code used to do, and never write "now", "new", "updated", "fixed", or "changed" in a comment. Change history belongs in commit messages.
- Reach for `for` and comprehensions over `while`, and for `match`/`case` over an `if`/`elif` chain dispatching on a value or a range.

Some rules shape a design before any gate could catch it. Know these by name and read them in `docs/rules.md` while choosing a shape rather than after being stopped: `own-model-dispatch` (a union answers through its members, never through `isinstance` over our own types), `abc-capability` (a capability ABC is an engine, never a surface a consumer holds), `model-free-function` (a model carries its own operations), and `constant-declaration` (a judgement reaches its caller as an overridable default).

### Exceptions No Rule Can See

A rule states the shape it refuses. These carve-outs are ours, and its diagnostic does not carry them:

- **Barrel files.** `__all__` and `__init__.py` re-exports are refused, and import goes directly to the module that defines the symbol. The exception is a standalone package's own top-level `__init__.py`, which may declare a public API that way — the package root only, never a subpackage.
- **Private prefixes.** Nothing is private, so a `_` prefix is refused on functions, methods, classes, and constants. An unused parameter (`_context`, `_exc_type`) is exempt: that is a linting convention, not a privacy one. What to do instead depends on why you wanted the prefix:
  - A helper that genuinely should not pollute the module namespace **nests inside its only caller**, which hides it without claiming privacy.
  - A wrapper whose only purpose is to call one other function, with no logic of its own, is not a helper worth hiding at all — inline it and let the caller reach the target directly.

---

## Tooling

`uv` is the package manager — `uv add <package>`, never edit pyproject.toml directly. Formatting and linting are ruff, type checking is pyright; `docs/contributing.md` carries the commands that have to be green.

`lup` itself is the one dependency not added that way. How a project obtains it — vendored here, from the package index, from git, or from a checkout on the same disk — is a mode `dev library` reads and rewrites, and the mode decides what upgrading even means. Ask `dev library status` before assuming lup's source is on disk to edit: in three of the four modes it is not. `docs/library.md` carries the modes and the move between them.

When policy says a command genuinely has to run outside the sandbox, put that command through the runtime's native per-call sandbox escalation on its first attempt. Do not replace the whole session with an unsandboxed one; the semantic policy still judges the escalated call, so an allowed command can be approved at that narrower boundary.

### lup-devtools

Development tooling is exposed as the `lup-devtools` CLI entry point, composed in `src/lup_template/devtools/main.py` from two halves: the workflow commands in `packages/lup/src/lup/devtools/`, and what only this repository has beside them. **Always use `lup-devtools` instead of ad-hoc commands.** Never use `uv run python -c "..."` or bare `python`/`python3` — these are denied by the Bash permission hook.

If you find yourself running the same command repeatedly, **add a command** — to `packages/lup/src/lup/devtools/` when another project on lup would want it, to `src/lup_template/devtools/` when only this one would.

`tmp/` is scratch: gitignored, so nothing written there reaches a diff, a reviewer, or the human — which is why it does not execute. Match the rung to the question: to **read** code, `py info`/`py source`/`py search`/`py imports` plus the codeintel tools answer without running anything; to **compute** something, `lup-devtools py eval '<expression>'` auto-imports and evaluates in the sandbox; with no sandbox available, add a devtools command. `docs/contributing.md` carries the rest of the ladder, down to a heredoc behind a `# lup: escalate: <why>` marker. The argument is reviewability, not power — an agent may already edit `devtools/` and run it.

`docs/commands.md` carries every command the CLI serves with a line on what each does, walked from the wired app at generation time rather than listed by hand — so a command exists there by existing, and reading it is how you find one you did not know to look for. `uv run lup-devtools <command> --help` gives its arguments and options; `docs/template.md` lists the sub-apps, rendered from the same typed roster the CLI itself wires.

### Generated Trees

`lup-devtools harness generate all` regenerates and reconciles every native plugin; `harness <runtime>` regenerates one and launches it. `docs/harness.md` carries the rest of the loop, how a launch reaches the plugin on each runtime, and the roster of every skill and agent this plugin ships. Personal cache, trust, and session state are never committed.

Both rosters are rendered from typed declarations: what is about agent work lives in `packages/lup/src/lup/devtools/harness/content/catalog.py`, what is about being a template in `src/lup_template/devtools/harness/content/catalog.py`, which composes both. Change the catalog that owns the subject, then regenerate.

### Code Intelligence

The `codeintel` tool group answers questions about code by *resolving* it, through a language server. **Prefer them over grep for anything about a name**, and prefer `rename_symbol` over an edit with `replace_all`, which cannot tell one scope from another; apply the edits it reports yourself. `docs/conventions.md` lists what each tool answers. `grep` is still right for what is genuinely characters: a string literal, a comment, a non-Python file.

---

## Configuration

`.env` holds template defaults; `.env.local` holds secrets, is gitignored, and overrides them. Configuration is loaded through pydantic-settings in `src/lup_template/agent/config.py`, which is the only module that reads the environment. `docs/template.md` lists the variables.

---

## Process & Communication

**Wait on pushed tool output rather than polling for it.** When a long-lived command returns a resumable tool call and the runtime offers an event-driven waiter, keep that call live and yield to the waiter. Repeated reads of a shell session are polling even when each read has a long timeout; they spend turns asking whether anything changed instead of resuming only when something did.

**Always surface a question as a question**, through whatever structured question facility the harness gives you, rather than as narration the user has to notice. This applies to clarifying requirements, offering choices, confirming destructive actions, proposing changes, and any situation needing user input. Even for open-ended questions, attach concrete options plus a free-form one — structured answers are what downstream notification parsing reads. When in doubt, ask.

**Explain from scratch, and walk through the options.** A finding handed over as a verdict cannot be judged, only accepted or refused on trust. Explain the underlying problem as though the reader has none of your context, then the options, then your own recommendation marked as yours. Propose rather than assume: show the relevant current state, give the rationale, offer alternatives. Prefer being slow and complete over being brief — the reader is deciding, and a decision made without the reasoning is one they have to re-derive later.

This is what makes a claim checkable rather than plausible. Verify each one against **what was actually asked** — the note's own words, the issue's own report — not against a title, a commit subject, or your own earlier summary. A claim that survives that check is worth stating plainly; one that does not is worth correcting out loud, including when the claim was yours.

**After every command invocation**, compare how it was actually used against how it is documented, and propose an update as a question the user answers. A user who supplies external docs, corrects your approach, asks for something the command should have covered, or ignores a section is telling you the command should evolve.

### Reporting Friction

When the tooling fights you, **fix it** rather than working around it and moving on. This repository owns the tooling that just obstructed you, so the cause is usually a file you can edit — the hook that refused, the command that half-completed, the classifier that guessed. Fix it on its own branch, so the repair does not ride along inside whatever the session was already doing, and so the diff that lands is about the friction rather than about two things at once.

**Open a GitHub issue when the repair is not one this session can make** — the cause sits outside this repository, the fix is a design change resting on a decision you do not have, or the friction is longstanding and reproducing it is itself the work. Filing is what a fix cannot reach rather than the first move: an issue spends somebody else's reading, where a fix spends nobody's. A workaround that lives in one session's narration teaches nobody, so what cannot be fixed still has to be written down.

Either way, record what you observed rather than what you concluded: the exact command, the exact error, the state it left behind, and what the recovery cost. Name the component that owns the fix — a commit message where you fixed it, the issue where you could not. Evidence is worth more than a guess at the cause, and evidence is what the self-improvement loop below consumes.

File that evidence with `uv run lup-devtools dev report-friction`; its required fields preserve the report shape and its repository target comes from this checkout. Pass `--issue NUMBER` to correct a report in place instead of duplicating it. Read `--help` for the exact options.

### External Resources

When a question is about the harness you are running under, its agent SDK, or its model API, read that runtime's own documentation rather than answering from memory: delegate to the documentation subagent your harness ships where it has one, or fetch the vendor's documentation directly — the Claude Code and Agent SDK documentation at https://docs.claude.com/ and https://code.claude.com/. The fetch scopes the permission policy admits are declared in `harness/catalog.py`. When the user provides documentation links, incorporate that knowledge into the guidance source or the relevant skill declaration.

---

## Self-Improvement Loop

`docs/self-improvement.md` carries the full loop: how to diagnose a failure through the pipeline, the three levels of analysis, what to track per session, and the anti-patterns to avoid. Read it when running the feedback-loop, review, or meta skills — each of them works from it.

**When analyzing failures:** Ask "what general principle would have prevented this?" not "what specific rule would catch this case?" The fix is almost never a prompt line about a specific decision. Instead: does the agent have enough context? The right tools? A strong enough model?

When the principle points to a workflow failure, fix the workflow at the exact juncture where the failure enters — don't add a warning about it. A step named "Classify each commit" invites whole-commit thinking regardless of how many times the text says "decompose." Renaming the step to "Extract portable pieces" and separating reading from judging makes the failure structurally impossible. Warnings coexist peacefully with the workflows they warn against; structural changes don't.

The durable fix is a capability, not a rule: trace the failure to the missing input or the workflow step where the wrong decision entered, and change that. A prompt rule coexists peacefully with the failure it warns about.
