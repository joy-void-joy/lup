# Debug: Trace an Error

**Do not hypothesize -- trace.** Find the actual logs, read the exact exception, and report what happened. Never list "likely causes" or suggest the user check things.

## Input

**Error text**: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

### 1. Search logs for the error

First, check if there are sessions with errors:

```bash
uv run lup-devtools session errors
```

Then search traces for the specific error text:

```bash
uv run lup-devtools session search "<distinctive part of error>"
```

If devtools search doesn't find it, fall back to Grep on `logs/` with the most specific substring from the error.

### 2. Find the right log file

If multiple log files match, identify the **most recent** one (logs are named by timestamp: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` or `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`).

If no matches found:

- Try `notes/sessions/` for meta-reflections mentioning the error
- Try broader search terms (exception class name, HTTP status code)
- If still nothing: report exactly what was searched and that no logs contain this error. State what logging would need to be added and where.

### 3. Read the full context

Once you find the log file containing the error:

1. **Read the traceback** -- Find the full exception chain. Read 50-100 lines around the error to see the complete traceback and what led to it.
2. **Trace backwards** -- What was the agent doing when the error occurred? Read earlier in the log to find the tool call or action that triggered it.
3. **Check the source** -- Use Read/Grep to find the exact line in the source code (`src/`) where the exception was raised or where the failing logic lives.

### 4. Report findings

Structure your report as:

**What happened:**

- The exact exception/error (quote the traceback)
- Which file and line in the source code

**Why it happened:**

- What the agent was doing at the time (from the log context)
- The chain of events that led to the error

**How to fix it:**

- Specific code changes needed (show the code, point to the file and line)

**If logs are insufficient:**

- State exactly what logging to add and where, so the error is captured next time
- Be specific: "Add `logger.exception(...)` at `src/lup/agent/core.py:42` inside the `except` block"

## Rules

- **Never guess.** If you can't find the error in the logs, say so. Don't speculate about what might have caused it.
- **Quote exactly.** Show the actual traceback and log lines, not paraphrased summaries.
- **Read the source.** After finding the error location, read the actual source code to understand the failure.
- **Be specific about fixes.** Point to exact files and lines, show before/after code.
