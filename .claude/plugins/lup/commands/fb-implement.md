# Implement: Make Changes

Implement changes identified during investigation, analysis, and reflection.

## Entry Gate

Use AskUserQuestion to present the prioritized change list with Bitter Lesson classification. User must approve before implementation.

**Bitter Lesson classification:**
- **Tool/capability** (preferred): Build or fix a tool, add a data source, improve automation
- **Principle** (acceptable): Add a general principle to prompts that helps across many cases
- **Rule/patch** (avoid): Task-type-specific rules, numeric adjustments, conditional exceptions

## Priority Order

### P0: Prompt health

If patches have accumulated (>3 since last rewrite):
- Study the 3 best traces — what did the agent do right?
- Study the 3 worst traces — where did the prompt mislead?
- Read the full prompt
- Rewrite the affected section from scratch (monolithic, no addendums)

### P1: Fix failing tools

From tool health analysis. Fix the root cause, not the symptom.

### P2: Build requested tools

From capability gap analysis. Discuss with user before building — use AskUserQuestion to present the capability gap, proposed approach, and alternatives.

### P3: Improve tool descriptions

Before changing prompts, check if the issue is a tool description problem:
- Agent using the wrong tool? → Clarify the "when" in the description
- Agent not using a tool at all? → Add stronger "when to use" triggers
- Agent misinterpreting results? → Document the return format

### P4: Improve subagents

From workflow assessments. Evaluate value vs cost.

### P5: Simplify prompts

Remove prescriptive rules. Add general principles. Don't add:
- Specific rules for task types
- Numeric adjustments ("add 5% for...")
- Patches for observed patterns
- Conditional exceptions

## After Implementation

1. Version bump: `/lup:bump`
2. Commit changes
3. Verify: `git diff --stat` confirms each change
4. Log changes in analysis doc:
   - **COMMITTED**: In git, verified
   - **PROPOSED**: Discussed but not implemented
   - **DEFERRED**: Identified but deprioritized

## Queue Next Evaluation

End the session by proposing sessions that test the improvements:

```bash
# Run evaluation sessions
uv run python -m lup.environment.cli loop "task1" "task2" "task3"
```

Choose sessions that are diverse in task type, exercise recently fixed or new tools, and include edge cases where the agent previously struggled.
