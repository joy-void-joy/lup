# Create Investigator Command

You are creating a new **investigator command** — a command where the user pastes raw output (logs, errors, console snippets, tool results) with minimal commentary, and the command guides you to trace the issue through code and logs and produce a diagnostic report.

This is distinct from `/lup:add-command` which creates general-purpose commands. Investigator commands share a specific pattern: raw input in, traced diagnosis out.

**Arguments provided**: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 0: Parse arguments

The first word is the **command name**. Everything after is a **brief description** of what the command investigates.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user what the command should be called and what it investigates.

## Step 1: Understand the domain

Before writing anything, understand what this investigator needs to do:

1. **Read existing investigator declarations** as reference:
   - `src/lup_template/devtools/harness/content/skills/debug.py` — traces errors through logs

2. **Explore the codebase** to understand the domain. Based on the description, identify:
   - What specific content will appear in the pasted trace? (tool calls, thinking blocks, error messages, subagent output, etc.)
   - Where are the relevant logs and artifacts on disk? (`logs/`, `notes/`, other directories)
   - What source code is most relevant? Which files in `src/` would the investigator need to read?
   - What devtools commands might be useful? (`uv run lup-devtools --help`)

3. **Align on the design with the user** before writing anything:
   - What are the common scenarios this investigator will handle?
   - What are the typical "anchors" in the pasted output that help trace the issue? (IDs, timestamps, function names, error codes, etc.)
   - What domain-specific knowledge should the command encode? (common failure modes, known gotchas, relevant architecture)

## Step 2: Design the command

Based on your exploration and the user's input, design the command. Existing investigator commands share these traits (but adapt to the domain):

**Philosophy**: "Don't hypothesize — trace." The command should guide you to find actual evidence, not speculate.

**Input handling**: The input is **always raw pasted output** via `$ARGUMENTS`. The user pastes trace logs, console output, error messages, or other raw text directly after the command. The command should never expect a file path, session ID, or structured input -- it works from whatever the user pastes. It should explain how to extract anchors (IDs, timestamps, tool names) from the pasted text and how to work with incomplete input.

**Investigation steps**: Domain-specific steps that trace from the pasted input to root cause. Each step should explain:

- What to look for
- Where to look (specific directories, files, scripts)
- What tools/commands to use
- When to ask the user for more context

**Report format**: What happened, why, and how to fix it — adapted to the domain.

**Rules**: Domain-specific rules about what to never do (guess, speculate, etc.) and what to always do (quote evidence, read source, etc.).

## Step 3: Declare the skill

Write the declaration to `content/skills/<command_name>.py` as a `models.Skill` — under `packages/lup/src/lup/devtools/harness/` when the investigation is one any project on lup would run, under `src/lup_template/devtools/harness/` when only this one would. Register it in that half's `content/catalog.py` (import `SKILL as SKILL_<NAME>`, add it to `LIBRARY_SKILLS` or `PROJECT_SKILLS`) and regenerate with `uv run lup-devtools harness generate all`. The artifacts under.claude/plugins/lup/commands/ under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/skills/ under Codex are generated from this — never write them by hand.

**Tools**: Choose the `tools` list based on what the investigator needs. Every
grant is a `ToolGrant` from `packages/lup/src/lup/types.py` — read that closed
type for the spellings rather than guessing. An investigator almost always
needs file reading and search; add scoped shell grants for listing and sizing
files or for the devtools it runs, a web grant if it needs outside context, and
a question grant if it may need clarification from the user.

**Content**: Write the prompt body as `models.TextPart` parts, splicing `models.ArgumentsRef()` where the pasted output lands. Use the design from Step 2.

## Step 4: Confirm and iterate

Show the user what was created — the first draft is rarely perfect. Ask the user with the AskUserQuestion tool, offering concrete options plus a free-text choice: what needs adjusting, if anything

## Rules

- **Read before writing** — Always explore the relevant codebase areas before designing the command. The command should reference actual file paths, actual script names, actual log locations.
- **Be specific** — Generic investigation steps ("search the logs") are useless. Point to specific directories, file patterns, scripts, and code locations.
- **Encode domain knowledge** — The whole point of an investigator command is that it captures knowledge you'd otherwise have to rediscover each time. Bake in common failure modes, known gotchas, and relevant architecture.
- **Keep it conversational** — ask when you need input. Don't assume.
