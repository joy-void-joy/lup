# Resolve Merge Conflicts

Resolve all merge conflicts in the working tree after a failed merge or rebase.

**User-provided context:** $ARGUMENTS

## Process

1. **Assess the situation**:

   ```bash
   # Determine if we're in a merge, rebase, or cherry-pick
   git status

   # List all conflicted files
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
   ```

2. **Understand what this branch does**:
   - Identify which branch is being merged into which
   - Review commits since this branch diverged from the base (max 10):
     ```bash
     # Find the merge base and show branch commits
     git log --oneline $(git merge-base HEAD MERGE_HEAD)..HEAD | head -10
     ```
   - Derive the **branch scope** -- a summary of everything this branch is about. If the branch does multiple things (e.g., "refactors CDF generation, adds new calibration tools, and fixes a test"), list all of them. The scope should cover the full set of intentional changes.
   - Also check the other side to understand what changed there:
     ```bash
     git log --oneline $(git merge-base HEAD MERGE_HEAD)..MERGE_HEAD | head -10
     ```
   - Use the user-provided context above for additional priorities

3. **For each conflicted file**:
   - Read the full file to see all conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
   - Understand what each side changed and why by reading the surrounding code
   - Check `git log --oneline -5 -- <file>` on both sides to understand the history
   - **Classify each conflict by branch scope** before resolving (see Resolution Decision Tree below)
   - Remove all conflict markers after resolution

4. **Validate the resolution**:
   - Read each resolved file to confirm no remaining conflict markers
   - Ensure the resolved code is syntactically correct and logically sound
   - Check for duplicate imports, repeated function definitions, or other merge artifacts

5. **Stage and verify**:

   ```bash
   # Stage resolved files
   git add <resolved-files>

   # Verify no conflicts remain
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

   # Show what will be committed
   git diff --cached --stat
   ```

6. **Complete the merge** (only if all conflicts are resolved):

   ```bash
   # For a merge:
   git commit --no-edit

   # For a rebase: git rebase --continue
   # For a cherry-pick: git cherry-pick --continue
   ```

## Core Principle: Bias Toward Inclusion

**Never silently drop code.** When resolving conflicts, the default is to keep both sides. Deleting a function, feature, or parameter that exists on either side requires explicit justification. If you can't confidently explain *why* something should be removed, keep it.

## Resolution Decision Tree

First classify each conflict hunk by **branch scope**, then resolve:

### Step A: Scope classification

Run scope classification to identify which conflicted files this branch touched:

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev conflicts --json
```

Use this output together with the branch scope summary from step 2 to classify each conflict hunk:

- **In-scope** -- The conflict is in code this branch intentionally changed (matches any part of the branch's purpose). **Take ours** (HEAD) -- this branch is the authority for these changes.
- **Out-of-scope** -- The conflict is in code this branch didn't intentionally modify (unrelated to any of the branch's purposes). **Take theirs** (MERGE_HEAD) -- the other branch has the more intentional changes here.
- **Mixed / ambiguous** -- Both sides made intentional changes to the same code, or you can't confidently classify. Proceed to Step B.

**Direction awareness:** The above assumes a typical feature-branch merge. In initialization or sync merges (pulling upstream into a new branch), the incoming side may be the richer one. Before classifying, verify which side has more content -- the side with more features/functions is the "authority" side. If "theirs" is richer, the default flips: out-of-scope hunks should take theirs, but in-scope hunks still need careful review.

### Step B: Resolve mixed/ambiguous conflicts

For hunks that don't clearly fall into in-scope or out-of-scope:

#### Auto-resolve (no user input needed)

- **Non-overlapping additions** -- Both sides add different new content (imports, functions, config entries). **Combine both.**
- **Clear superset** -- One side is a strict superset of the other. Take the superset.
- **Whitespace / formatting only** -- Take either side consistently.
- **Identical intent** -- Both sides made the same change with trivially different wording. Take either.
- **Refactoring vs features** -- One side refactored (renamed, reorganized) while the other added new features. **Keep both** -- apply the refactoring AND the features. Never let a rename swallow an addition.

#### Ask the user (use AskUserQuestion)

- **Different approaches** -- Both sides solve the same problem differently. Present both approaches with context and ask which to keep or how to combine.
- **Conflicting deletions vs additions** -- One side removes code the other side modifies. Show what was removed and what was changed, ask which direction to go.
- **Structural reorganization** -- Both sides restructured the same section differently. Present the two structures and ask for preference.
- **Ambiguous priority** -- When you genuinely can't tell which version is better or more complete without domain knowledge the user has.

**When asking, always:**

- **Show the exact conflict** -- Before the AskUserQuestion call, output both versions as labeled code blocks so the user can read the actual content
- Explain what each side was trying to do
- Suggest a recommendation if you have one
- Offer "combine both" as an option when feasible

## Deletion Audit (before completing the merge)

After resolving all conflicts but **before staging and committing**, run a deletion audit:

```bash
# Compare the merge result against both parents to find dropped code
# Functions/classes/commands that exist in EITHER parent but not in the result
git diff HEAD -- <conflicted-files>      # what ours lost
git diff MERGE_HEAD -- <conflicted-files> # what theirs lost
```

For each conflicted file, check: **did the resolution remove any functions, classes, CLI commands, or significant code blocks that existed on either side?** If yes, that deletion must be intentional and justified -- not a side effect of taking one side over the other.

Common signs of accidental deletion:
- An entire function/command at the end of a file that was on one side but not the other (conflict resolution took the shorter version)
- Function parameters or CLI options that existed on one side but are absent in the resolution
- Import statements dropped without the corresponding code being removed

**If you find unjustified deletions, fix them before completing the merge.**

## General Guidelines

- **Watch for semantic conflicts** -- Even after resolving textual conflicts, check that the combined code makes sense (e.g., a renamed variable on one side but old name used on the other)
- **Check adjacent code** -- Sometimes conflicts reveal that nearby (non-conflicting) code also needs updating for consistency
- **Err toward larger** -- When the two sides differ in size and you can't determine intent, keep the larger version. It's easier to remove unwanted code later than to recover lost code.
