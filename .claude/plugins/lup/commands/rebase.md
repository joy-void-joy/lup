# Rebase and PR

Clean up the commit history on the current feature branch, push it, and open (or update) a PR.

## Determine Branches

### Base branch (`<base>`)

Run `uv run lup-devtools dev pr sync-base --json` (step 1 below) -- it reports the base branch and a `base_source`. `recorded` (from worktree creation) and `explicit` are authoritative. `guessed` means topology alone picked it: the command merges nothing and exits non-zero. Ask the user with the AskUserQuestion tool, offering concrete options plus a free-text choice: which branch is the true base, then rerun as `sync-base --base <branch>`.

Confirm against the divergence, not the name that sounds right. `git log --oneline <candidate>..HEAD` on the true base shows this branch's own commits; on a wrong one it shows hundreds, which is the tell that the whole history between the two branches is about to be treated as yours.

### PR target (`<target>`)

If a target branch was provided as an argument (`$ARGUMENTS`), use it. Otherwise, `<target>` defaults to `<base>`.

## Pre-rebase Validation

### 1. Commit pending changes

Invoke `/lup:commit` to commit any uncommitted work before starting the rebase.

### 2. Sync and merge base

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev pr sync-base --json
```

A `guessed` base exits non-zero having merged nothing -- settle the base as above and rerun with `--base <branch>`. If conflicts are reported, resolve with `/lup:merge` (no argument) first.

### 3. Fold local grants into the canonical policy

Check whether `.claude/settings.local.json` exists. Its permission entries are ad-hoc grants one person accepted; leaving them there means the next person re-approves the same prompts.

`.claude/settings.json` is a generated artifact (`harness.project-settings`) -- never hand-merge into it. The next `lup-devtools harness generate all` regenerates it from the policy and drops the edit. Shell, fetch, and edit permissions belong to the canonical semantic policy instead.

Classify each entry:

- **Already covered by the policy** -- drop it from the local file. Most read-only commands are.
- **A genuine gap** -- invoke `/lup:hooks` to add it to the canonical policy, regenerate both native plugins, and commit that as a separate commit.
- **User-specific** (plugin toggles, personal model choice) -- leave it in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### 4. Run checks

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev check
```

Fix any failures before proceeding.

## Process

### 5. Push and open PR

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev pr push --json
```

**If no existing PR** (first run), draft a title and summary, then:

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev pr create --base "<target>" --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
```

**If PR already exists**, skip -- we'll force-push the cleaned history later.

### 6. Understand all changes

- Review the full diff: `git diff <base>...HEAD`
- Read changed files to understand the complete set of modifications
- Think about logical units of work (features, refactors, fixes, tests, docs)
- **Ignore existing commit history** -- focus on what makes sense as a clean sequence

### 7. Reset and rebuild commits

```bash
git reset --soft <base>
```

All changes are now staged. For each logical unit of work:
- Selectively unstage with `git reset HEAD <files>`, then stage and commit relevant pieces
- Or use `git commit` with specific files to build atomic commits
- Order logically: dependencies first, then features, then polish
- Use conventional format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`

### 8. Force push and update PR

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev pr push --force --json
```

Update the PR body with a commit list:

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev pr update <PR_NUMBER> --body "<updated body>"
```

Return the PR URL to the user.

## Guidelines

- **Never rebase dev/main/master**
- **Confirm before force push**
- **Use --force** (not --force-with-lease) -- after `git reset --soft`, --force-with-lease rejects the diverged ref
- **Keep meaningful history**: Don't squash everything into one commit
- **Write good messages**: Future you will thank present you
