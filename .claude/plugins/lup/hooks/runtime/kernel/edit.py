    it makes one gate request what the other grants — the same split

    Moving one is the same shape and was refused for the same reason. Adopting

    ``None`` is the bare directive, covering every rule. A new id, a widened

    Two limits, named rather than implied. Re-siting a rule's directive onto a

    ``allowances`` names what a human already approved for the concern this
    edit belongs to. A grant releases exactly the gate it names and nothing
    adjacent, so an ungranted session sees the unchanged lattice.

    The two marker families are gated in opposite directions. Feedback is
    judged by :func:`marker_decision`: adding it asks, deleting it is denied,
    and the way through is to convert a note into a claim the review pass can
    check. A suppression is gated where it is declared — an added line
    carrying an `ignore` directive, which :func:`antipattern_decision` asks
    about — while retiring one needs no gate at all: the same decision
    re-reads the uncovered line, allows it where nothing trips, and denies
    where the violation is still live. What makes that verdict trustworthy is
    :func:`refined_exempt_lines`, without which a rule broader than the defect
    it names holds its own suppression in place forever.

    ``acceptance_guard`` is the one gate that answers before the relaxations
    below rather than through them, because it asks whether the file may be
    edited at all. Undeclared, a project judges its tests by the same
    lattice as anything else, which is what every project did before the
    guard existed.

    Each gate reaches as far as its own reason. Anti-patterns, the size gate
    and the full-write gate are all about how production code reads and how
    much of it a reviewer can hold at once, so all three stop at production;
    the marker gate follows the feedback instead and stops only at scratch,
    where nothing persists to be read. A full write only ever asks about
    creating a file — an overwrite carries its predecessor as ``before`` —
