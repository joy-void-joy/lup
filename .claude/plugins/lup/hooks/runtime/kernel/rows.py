    ``subcommand`` and ``operation`` are ``""`` at the levels a rule does not

    named flags appears among the command's remaining words. On the
    command-level row of a subcommand-gated command, ``ask_flags`` guard the
    global options before the subcommand and ``value_flags`` name globals that
    consume the following word (``git -C <path>``), so a flag value is never
    read as the subcommand. ``allow_flags`` name a pure read-only form of a
    non-allow row (``ssh-add -l``): the row de-escalates to allow only when
    every remaining word is exactly one of the named flags, so clusters,
    ``=`` values, paths, and unresolved expansions never qualify.
    ``read_verbs`` name action-selecting flags of a command that enforces one
    action at a time (``git config --get``): a non-allow row de-escalates to
    allow when a declared verb appears among words that are all literal and
    free of guarded flags, because the verb pins the invocation to its query
    action regardless of the other words.

    ``sandbox`` says where this command has to run, independently of who
    decides it: a verb that reaches a remote is unusable confined however the
    effect reads, and a verb whose blast radius wants the OS boundary keeps it
    however ordinary the effect reads.

    Both axes arrive already resolved down the nesting, so matching one row is
    the whole answer. ``effect_source`` and ``sandbox_source`` say which level
