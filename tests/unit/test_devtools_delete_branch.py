"""Behavior tests for `lup-devtools dev delete`.

Deletion is preflighted: every precondition is evaluated before anything is
touched, so a dry run reports what the real path went on to check, and a run
that cannot finish changes nothing. These pin both halves — that a blocked
step is named as blocked rather than annotated with the flag that was passed,
that a refusal leaves the checkout standing without having attempted its
removal, and that a worktree stranded by an earlier failure is pruned rather
than left for the caller to discover.
