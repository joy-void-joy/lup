"""Boundary scan behavior: what breaches, what is sanctioned, what escapes.

The scan (:mod:`lup.codescan.boundaries`) guards two directions. Inward, it is
the regression guard that keeps per-engine adapter imports from creeping
outside ``lup.adapters``, and the live tree is pinned at zero breaches.
Outward, the placement rule judges whether a library data table reaches its
adopters as an overridable default; the live tree still carries known
violations, so those tests work from fixtures rather than pinning a count.
The shell vocabulary is the exception: it has moved out of the library, and
two tests hold it there against the live tree.
