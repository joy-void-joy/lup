# lup: ignore[string-replace, tuple-shape]
# Test fixtures and assertions construct these shapes deliberately.
"""Smoke and behavior tests for the lup-devtools CLI.

The smoke test walks the root typer app's full command tree (sub-apps and
nested groups) and invokes ``--help`` on every command. This catches
import-time crashes (e.g. a module-level ``sh.Command`` for a missing
binary) and option wiring errors, entirely offline.

The pr tests pin output behavior with a stubbed gh: ``pr merge`` must
print its MergeResult even when the tree-dir lookup raises ``typer.Exit``.
