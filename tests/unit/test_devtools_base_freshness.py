"""Behavior tests for the base-freshness probe and the two gates that read it.

A checkout cannot tell from its own contents that its base has moved, so the
probe asks the remote and every entry point that opens a session asks the
probe. These run against real repositories with a local path as origin: what
is under test is which ref a checkout answers to and what git says about it,
and a scripted double would only restate the answers.
