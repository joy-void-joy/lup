"""What a commit does when a generated artifact is behind its source.

The guard is a refusal, and a refusal is only worth what an attempt proves, so
these tests write a real repository, arm it, and run `git commit` — the whole
point being that reading the installed configuration would have said the guard
was fine on the day it let two stale commits through.

The miniature repository copies one source verbatim into one generated file,
which is the shape of the case that actually failed: the policy kernel modules
are copied into both plugin trees byte for byte, so rewording a comment in one
of them makes both trees stale without changing anything either does. The hook
runs the production drift verdict over that copy rather than a stand-in for it.
