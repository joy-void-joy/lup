"""Behavior tests for the ownership-manifest merge driver.

The manifests are generated digest proofs, so two branches always disagree on
``source_digest`` and on every ``sha256`` a regeneration touched. Merging that
text has no meaning: the driver keeps one side so the merge resolves, and
regeneration settles the digests against the merged tree afterwards.
