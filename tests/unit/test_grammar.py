"""The typed AST grammar refines broad rules without weakening the hook.

`lup.codescan.grammar` decides a site by where its subject is declared, so
these exercise the three answers a type oracle can give — declared in the
family, declared outside it, and not resolvable — plus the hook's unchanged
line rule, the dead directives the refinement exposes, and the pyright client
that implements the port when one is installed.
