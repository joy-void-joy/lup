"""Which runs still hold the branches they leased, and which have let go.

A lease is indistinguishable from abandoned work by every signal a branch
survey has: commits the integration branch lacks, and no pull request driving
them. So the survey asks the run directory instead, and a run that answers
holds its branch out of the sweep entirely.

The distinction these tests pin is which phases answer. Finishing releases a
lease because the join machinery carried the work out; failing and aborting do
not, and a sweep that treats them as release offers to land or drop branches
whose work nobody has salvaged — the two verbs that each destroy something.
