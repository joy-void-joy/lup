"""A generated table escapes what it holds, wherever the value came from.

Escaping used to be the caller's to remember, so the interesting cases are the
ones a caller would have had to think about: a pipe, which ends a cell early;
either line ending, which ends the row; and markup, which a reader would
otherwise see interpreted rather than quoted. A link's destination is checked
too, since it is the one value a cell does not otherwise escape. None of them
reaches a caller here — the part
is handed the literal value and renders it — so what these pin is that every
kind of cell escapes, not that some helper was called correctly.
