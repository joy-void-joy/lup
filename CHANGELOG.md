# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-23

Breaking capability-composition and semantic-policy release.

- Replaced engine/client/options service locators with narrow `SessionFactory`,
  `Session`, `Turn`, event, interrupt, steer, fork, binding, render, launch, and
  policy capabilities.
- Added strict typed turn-bound `submit_output`, whole-logical-turn wrappers,
  debounced background scheduling, immutable routing, profile transforms, and
  Claude/Codex concrete factories.
- Moved Codex execution to typed live app-server JSON-RPC and records the
  current dynamic-tool rebinding limitation explicitly.
- Added a single Pydantic harness catalog, deterministic Claude/Codex artifact
  compilation, validation, safe reconciliation, ownership manifests, hermetic
  semantic policy dispatchers, Codex cache verification, and named launchers.
- Added the persisted DAG resolver with question brokering, isolated leases and
  worktrees, semantic multi-parent joins, bounded review, integration,
  verification, final review, and cleanup records. Native entries scan and
  organize inline notes through the shared Python core without modifying the
  user's checkout.
- Added the project-wide `abc-capability` AST rule and typed suppression audit.
- Added the semantic shell decision lattice: erased rule tables judge every
  command, subcommand, and flag tier; unjudged work denies with a
  `# lup: escalate:` recipe; loops, conditionals, case arms, subshells, brace
  groups, and `$(...)` substitutions classify recursively over frozen variable
  bindings; `find -exec` payloads, `timeout`/`nice` wrappers, read-only
  `sed`/`awk`/`curl` screens, and quoted heredocs are judged in place; segments
  join deny > ask > defer > allow.
- Added launcher-verified OS-sandbox awareness: a `HookSet` sandbox declaration
  compiles into settings, launch, and doctor; unjudged work defers to the
  active sandbox boundary, a `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` escape re-enters the
  deny lattice, and Codex launches establish the interactive sandbox envelope.
- Added the Codex guidance flavor: shared template sections render both
  `TEMPLATE_CLAUDE.md` and a native `TEMPLATE_AGENTS.md`, with intentional
  differences recorded in docs/platform-differentiation.md.
- Added `# lup: defer[<wake condition>]:` parked-work notes with wake-gated
  clearing; tracking files are retired and `dev check` stays red while any
  deferred note exists.
- Renamed the downstream registry to `sync.json` with a documented contract
  (docs/template.md) and a legacy fallback.
- Added human-owned file protection compiled from the hook catalog: README.md
  edits always ask and never auto-allow.
- Added generated-artifact provenance banners with ownership documentation
  (docs/harness.md), and extracted the resolver entry and hook
  dispatchers into real source assets.
- Retyped the harness catalog around annotated domain types, decomposed the
  harness CLI into composition, drift, reconcile, doctor, resolve, and launch
  modules, and gave anti-pattern rules token-masked syntactic contexts shared
  by the auditor and the hook kernel.
- Hardened the resolver entry's argument normalization and pinned
  worker-crash, revision-exhaustion, and join-conflict recovery legs.
- Added the pre-commit generation gate and the native-nightly workflow
  (deterministic evidence checks plus secrets-gated live smokes), and audited
  the test suite for load-bearing coverage.
- Removed all legacy engine, client, broad options, profile, background-driver,
  replay-stream, and provider-wide tool-registry modules. There is no legacy
  facade.
- Fixed `LocalProcessLauncher` to capture through pipes so git output stays
  plain regardless of the host pager configuration, and made resolver resume
  treat the persisted phase as a monotonic high-water mark so hard-killed runs
  recover from every mid-phase kill window.

This was a clean breaking release with no compatibility facade: every removed
surface above has a replacement in the current API, which
[docs/library.md](docs/library.md) describes directly.
