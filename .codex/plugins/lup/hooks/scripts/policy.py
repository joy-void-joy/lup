    but only if something is actually written down, or the relaxation is
    just the asking removed.

    **Two kinds of deferral reach here and they are worth very different

    relaxation working -- a rule looked, and the boundary answered for the
    loss -- and it is an audit trail rather than a candidate. Collapsing them

    command has run. The later event was proposed and refuted: a runtime
    offers both "yes" and "yes, don't ask again" and the later event cannot

    command already written down is skipped, and the file is a set: what a
    diff shows is what this session met that no session had met before.

    was launched from, and it is the property worth keeping — a sibling
    worktree holds the same relative path with different contents.

    Only where the checkout holds nothing does the spelling decide. A bare
    name goes to the OS to find on ``PATH``, for a project whose toolchain
    lives somewhere else entirely: a conda environment, a pyenv shim, a
    system or user-level install, an environment ``UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT``
    put outside the project. A path that resolved to nothing stays nothing,
    because a project that named a location meant that location.

    Accepting only the first is what made this gate unavailable rather than
    configurable. A declared program it could not resolve produced no
    diagnostics and said nothing about why, so a project outside one layout
    did not get a weaker check — it got silence indistinguishable from a
    clean file, on every edit.

    A bare name is asked of the checkout's own environment before ``PATH``,
    because that is where a project's toolchain is installed and asking is
    what keeps the declaration from naming a layout. Spelling the path in
    would answer only for the layout it spelled: ``.venv`` is `uv`'s default
    and nothing else's, so a project that redirected it, or that installs
    through conda or pyenv, resolved to nothing and was gated in silence.
    The scripts directory comes from the running interpreter — ``bin`` on
    POSIX, ``Scripts`` on Windows — because that is a property of how Python
    is installed rather than of any project, and reading it is what keeps
    this from being a second layout assumption behind the one it replaces.

    nobody edited. Running the checker per edit has no root to go stale:
    the file names its own checkout, and that is where the check runs.

    The checkout alone does not decide it. A checker finds the interpreter
    whose packages it resolves against by looking down ``PATH``, and a hook
    inherits whichever one the session was launched with, so a check running
    in one tree reads another tree's installed packages and calls every
    third-party import unresolvable. The checker's own directory goes first:
    that is the environment it was installed into, and therefore the one
    belonging to the checkout that holds the file. A checker the checkout
    does not hold has no such directory to prefer, and keeps the ``PATH`` it
    inherited — that is where the OS is about to find it.

    Reported for the edited file alone. The checker resolves whatever the
    file imports, so it can have opinions about the whole tree, and a hook
    that repeated them would answer every edit with the same backlog.

    Anything that goes wrong is no diagnostics. A checker that is missing, or
    slow, or writes something this cannot read, is not evidence about the
    edit — and this runs after the tool, so the alternative to saying
    nothing is failing an edit that already happened.

    *suffixes* is what the checker can read. A type checker handed a manifest,
    a document, or a lockfile parses it as source and reports the whole file
    as broken, so every edit to one answers with a wall of errors about lines
    the edit never touched — which teaches a reader to scroll past the output
    that exists to be read. It is a default rather than a constant because the
    checker is the caller's choice: a project whose checker reads more than
    Python says so instead of editing this.

    A file mid-merge is the same case arriving from the other direction. Its
    conflict markers are not source in any language, so the checker reports the
    file as broken from the first one onward and every line it names is about
    the merge rather than about the edit — during a resolution, which is
    exactly when a reader is editing that file and has the least attention to
    spare for a wall of output that cannot be acted on.

    credential belongs outside the checkout rather than inside one.

    Silent about its own failure, and deliberately. This runs in front of a
