    Codex reads the directory it ran in, where Claude reads the edited file.
    Not a lesser answer here, and not an available one either way: Codex
    names its files inside the patch envelope, and the parser that decodes
    one validates its context against the document on disk — which this
    event runs after the patch already rewrote. Re-decoding it here would
    fail on exactly the edits it was called for. Codex hands over its
    working directory instead, which Claude's hook is promised nothing
    about, and that is the same fact one step coarser.

    Coarser is enough to say which checkout is being edited and not enough
    to type-check what changed, so Codex records the edition and Claude also
    reports diagnostics. Checking the directory instead would answer every
    patch with every finding in the tree, most of them about files this
    edit never touched.
