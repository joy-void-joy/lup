# lup: Escaping the sandbox is a different axis from permission and wants its
# own field beside this one, not a member inside it: these four answer *who
# decides*, escaping answers *where it runs*, and folding them together forces
# an ask-plus-escalate member next, then a deny-plus-escalate. Keep this closed.
# The neutral kernel must also never learn `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, which is
# one runtime's spelling — Codex matches on this type and has no sandbox
# concept. Even if the unprompted rendering proves impossible, the field still
# earns its place: Claude renders `escalate` as an ask whose reason says to
# re-run unsandboxed, and a runtime that cannot escalate degrades to the plain
# effect instead of silently doing nothing.
#
# lup: The human settled the composition the note above asks for. The sandbox
# field takes three values and composes with the effect:
#
#   ask   + out    -> ask, warning that this will run out of the sandbox
#   deny           -> deny, whatever the sandbox says
#   allow + in     -> run inside the sandbox
#   allow + defer  -> run, deferring to the ambient sandbox status
#   allow + out    -> run outside the sandbox, unprompted
#
# Deny short-circuits, so the axis never softens a refusal. Vocabulary is ours to
# pick; the shape is what was decided. This subsumes any read-only-versus-write
# rule: express that by assigning allow+out to reads and ask+out to writes in the
# policy, rather than teaching a renderer to tell them apart.
