# Tool Review: Tools, Servers & Pipeline

Review all MCP servers, tools, and subagents. Draw an outline of the pipeline and each tool, then assess: does it make sense? What's good? What's missing?

## Phase 1: Pipeline Overview

Before cataloging individual tools, map the **end-to-end flow**:

1. Read `src/lup_template/agent/toolsets.py` first. It is the tool-group
   registry — the one place a group is added — so it, not `core.py`, is the
   inventory of what exists. Each group becomes one MCP server, which is also
   the unit the permission policy can withhold whole.

2. Read `src/lup_template/agent/core.py` to understand:
   - How a session is opened: which `SessionFactory` is built, and which
     wrapper layers `decorated_session_factory` puts around it (budget,
     timeout, correction, display, persistence, tracing)
   - How the registered groups become servers, and which run in-process
     versus in a subprocess
   - What one turn asks for — the `TurnRequest`, its `output_type`, and the
     `effort` and `autonomy` it carries
   - How the final output is produced and returned

3. Read `src/lup_template/agent/tool_policy.py` to understand:
   - Which tools are gated by conditions (API keys, modes, etc.)
   - Are there tools registered but conditionally unavailable?

4. Read `src/lup_template/agent/subagents.py` and
   `src/lup_template/agent/tools/nested.py`. Delegation comes in four
   shapes that are not interchangeable, and an audit that conflates them
   cannot say whether a job is in the right one: a **native subagent** the
   harness dispatches inside this session, a **nested agent** opened inside a
   tool handler and invisible to the harness, a **background agent**
   coalescing state changes into debounced turns, and a **persistent** agent
   that lives over time and wakes on events. `docs/orchestration.md` carries
   the catalog.

5. Draw a pipeline diagram (ASCII or markdown) showing:
   ```
   Input → Agent → [MCP Servers / Tools / Subagents] → Output
   ```
   Show which servers provide which tools, how subagents relate to the main agent, and where data flows between components.

## Phase 2: Tool Inventory

Read every file in `src/lup_template/agent/tools/` and build a **tool outline** — not just a table, but a readable summary of each tool's purpose.

For each tool file:
1. Read the file
2. List every `@lup_tool`-decorated handler with its name and a one-line
   description. The input and output models are the contract — read the
   `Field(description=...)` on each, because that text is the agent's only
   documentation for the field
3. Note which group it belongs to, from the registry read in Phase 1
4. Note whether a recoverable failure raises `ToolError` with something the
   agent can act on, or returns prose describing the problem
5. Note external dependencies (APIs, config keys, packages)

For remote/external MCP servers:
- Read `src/lup_template/agent/core.py` for `LupMcpServerConfig` values and
  the server list they are assembled into
- Read `src/lup_template/agent/config.py` for MCP-related settings
- Check `pyproject.toml` for MCP server dependencies
- Search with `grep` for `npx`, `uvx`, or other MCP server launch patterns

Present as a grouped outline:

```
Server: main
  - tool_name — What it does in one sentence
  - tool_name — What it does in one sentence

Server: reflect
  - tool_name — ...

Remote: external-service
  - tool_name — ...

Subagents:
  - How they're created, what tools they get, what they're used for
```

## Phase 3: Assessment — Does It Make Sense?

With the pipeline and inventory in hand, assess the design:

### What's Good

- Which tools are well-designed and at the right abstraction level?
- Where does the organization match the domain well?
- Are there tools that clearly earn their place (high value, clean interface)?

### What's Questionable

- Are there tools at the wrong level of granularity (too coarse or too fine)?
- Does the implementation match the interface? (Read the actual code — does the tool deliver what its docstring promises?)
- Are tool names consistent and self-explanatory?
- Do input/output patterns follow consistent conventions?
- Do tools use the shared MCP plumbing (`lup_tool` for definition, `ToolError` from `lup.mcp` for recoverable failures)?
- Is anything in the wrong server or confusingly organized?

### What's Missing

Reason from first principles — given the agent's domain, what capabilities are absent?
- Data sources not covered
- Reasoning tools that could help (statistical computation, simulation, etc.)
- Workflow capabilities missing (caching, batching, etc.)
- Does the agent's system prompt reference capabilities that don't exist as tools?

### What's Redundant

Read the implementations side by side:
- Do any tools hit the same API or compute the same thing with different parameters?
- Are there tools whose functionality is a subset of another tool?
- Are there tools better served by an external MCP server (or vice versa)?

**Optional validation:** Check trace data **filtered to current version** for zero-call tools or co-occurrence patterns — but only report issues confirmed in the current code.

## Phase 4: Report

Present findings as:

```markdown
## Tool Review

### Pipeline
[ASCII diagram showing the flow]

### Tool Outline
[Grouped list from Phase 2]

### What Works Well
- [Strengths of the current design]

### What's Questionable
- [Issues, inconsistencies, naming problems]

### Gaps
- [Missing capabilities, ranked by expected impact]

### Redundancies
- [Tools that overlap or could be merged]

### Ideas
- [Concrete suggestions for improvement, scoped by what each touches — never by time estimates]
```

## Rules

- **Draw the pipeline first.** Understanding the flow makes individual tool assessments meaningful.
- **Read the code, don't guess.** Open every tool file and read the actual implementations. Tool names and docstrings don't tell the full story.
- **Ground in the current version.** When running devtools commands, they auto-scope to the current agent version. Unfiltered aggregates mix old bugs with current state.
- **Think from the agent's perspective.** The agent sees a flat list of tools. Does the naming and organization help it choose the right tool?
- **Propose, don't implement.** This is a review, not a refactoring session. Present findings and let the user decide what to act on.
- **Put decisions and prioritization to the user** rather than settling them yourself.
