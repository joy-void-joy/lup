# Land Every Branch

Drive every local branch to its terminal state. Each one is classified by whether its commits have reached the integration branch — the ones that have not get landed, the ones that have get cleared — so no branch sits in a silent bucket waiting to go stale.

## Arguments

- **branch-name ...** (optional): one or more branches to dispose of. If any are provided, runs in targeted mode over all of them. If omitted, sweeps every branch.

Raw arguments: `the arguments supplied with this skill invocation`

Parse the raw arguments into a list of **branch names**: split on whitespace and commas, dropping bare connectors (`and`, `&`, `+`). Every remaining token names a branch. An empty list means full sweep mode; otherwise targeted mode runs over the whole list.

## Process

### 1. Settle the working tree

Read a dirty tree before writing it, because only one of the three cases it can be is a commit:

- **On the integration branch.** Committing code here is forbidden. Survey first, then check the dirty paths against every branch that could already carry them — `git diff <branch> -- <paths>` reports nothing where one does. Work a branch already holds is a stale duplicate, to discard or stash rather than commit; work no branch holds belongs on a branch of its own.
- **On a feature branch, where the work is that branch's own.** Invoke `$lup:commit`.
- **Anything else.** Ask.

Report which case it is and what the comparison showed, and let the user settle it. A sweep is about to act on every branch in the repository; opening it with a commit nobody asked for is the one move no later disposition can undo.

## Targeted Mode (branch names provided)

1. Run `uv run lup-devtools dev survey --json`.
2. Resolve every named branch against the survey. Report each name that matches nothing; stop only when none of them resolve.
3. Show every resolved branch's `disposition` and `reason` in one table, then Request explicit user approval before carrying out the actions those dispositions imply. Reason: the branches may hold work the user has not looked at.
4. Carry out each disposition's action from the table below, taking every `LAND` branch through step 6 and every branch an open PR is driving through step 7.

## Full Sweep Mode (no argument)

### 2. Collect data

```bash
uv run lup-devtools dev survey --json
```

Every branch arrives with a `disposition` and a `reason` already computed. **Do not re-derive them** — the classifier is shared with `dev status`, so a judgement made here would drift from the one made there.

### 3. Reconcile against the runs holding branches

Read `runs` before you read `branches`. Each entry is a resolver run holding branches out of the sweep, and `alive` says whether anything is still answerable for them.

A run with `alive: false` holds work that no verb here reaches: it is not landing on its own, and nothing will retire its leases. Report it before the table — the run id, how many branches, and `uv run lup-devtools harness resolve status --run-id <id>` for what it was doing when it stopped — and ask what should happen to the run before offering any per-branch action. Landing its branches by hand bypasses the join machinery the run never ran, which is the whole reason the lease holds them.

Do not present a dead run's branches as a to-do list. One decision about the run is the honest question; twenty-six decisions about its branches is the same question asked in a form that hides what it is.

### 4. Present the sweep

One table covering every branch, ordered `LAND` first (that is the work at risk), then the `KEEP` rows an open PR is driving (work already asked for, waiting on nothing but an order to merge in), then `DELETE`/`STALE`, then the rest of `KEEP`/`CURRENT`:

| Branch | Disposition | Unique | Rewr | Diff | Dirt | PR | Proposed action |

`Dirt` is the survey's `changes` — what that branch's worktree holds uncommitted. It never changes a disposition, only what carrying one out costs: a dirty worktree makes a delete refuse until forced, and forcing discards those files, so a dirty row is one to read before proposing anything.

`Rewr` is the survey's `rewritten` — how many of that branch's unique commits already name a subject in the integration branch. Containment is decided by patch-id, which a rewrite changes, so a commit that landed rebased, reworded, or squashed reads as unlanded ever after and a pre-rewrite snapshot presents its whole history as work at risk. **It is a signal, never a verdict**: a shared subject is not proof, so where it is set, go and check — `git cherry -v <integration> <branch>` marks with `-` what patch-id already matches, and comparing the remaining subjects against `git log <integration>` finds the rewrites it cannot see. Report what the comparison showed; never subtract it from `Unique` and never let it retire work on its own.

**Group the `LAND` rows by the run holding them**, where `runs` gives one, and label the group with the run rather than repeating it per row. Branches from one run are one situation; listed flat they read as unrelated work that happens to share a prefix.

**Report each group's union, not the sum of its rows.** Branches from a run are stacked, so a branch's `unique_commits` counts commits its siblings also carry — summing them multiplies the same work by how many branches contain it. `git rev-list --count ^<integration> <branch>...` over the group is the real figure, and the two can differ by more than a factor of two.

**Offer only the branches no sibling contains.** A branch listed in another's `contained_in` lands when that one does, so proposing both asks for a decision that has already been made. Name the ones riding along under the branch that carries them, so nothing looks dropped.

## Acting on Dispositions (both modes)

### 5. Act on each disposition

| Disposition | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LAND` | Holds commits the integration branch lacks, with no PR driving it | Land it — step 6 |
| `DELETE` | Reached the integration branch, or its PR merged | `uv run lup-devtools dev delete <branch>`; where `Dirt` is set it refuses, so compare that worktree against the integration branch and report what forcing would discard before asking |
| `STALE` | Every commit already cherry-picked into the integration branch | Confirm, then delete |
| `KEEP` | Protected, an open PR is already driving it, a resolver run holds its lease, or it is a worktree reserved at the integration tip | Read which of the four it is: protected leaves it alone; an open PR offers it — step 7; a resolver run is step 3, and one with `alive: false` holds it forever; a reserved workspace is somebody's next session, so leave it |
| `UNRELATED` | Shares no history with the integration branch | Never rebase or merge it — both would replay an unrelated tree. Report it and ask; an adopted subtree or a wrongly-pushed branch are the usual causes, and neither is this sweep's to settle |
| `CURRENT` | The branch checked out here | Never delete; warn if it would otherwise qualify |

### 6. Landing a LAND branch

Land one branch at a time, oldest divergence first — rebase, merge, and push before the next branch is touched. Every branch that lands moves the integration branch, so a rebase run ahead of a sibling's merge carries a base that no longer exists.

Ask the user, per branch, which route to take:

- **Open a PR** — relocate into that branch's worktree: start a session rooted at <the survey's worktree field> and continue there — this runtime cannot move a running session, so work carried on here would land in the checkout it started from. Create one first via `uv run lup-devtools dev worktree create <branch>` when `worktree` is null. Then run `$lup:rebase`.
- **Merge directly** — take the same route into the worktree and through `$lup:rebase`, then merge from the integration checkout with `$lup:merge <branch>`. `sync-base` has already pulled the integration branch in, so the merge is a fast-forward, and pushing it closes the PR the rebase opened. Suits small, uncontroversial work that needs no review.
- **Retire it** — the work is not worth landing. After explicit confirmation, `uv run lup-devtools dev retire <branch> --reason "<why>"`, which pushes, opens a pull request, closes it without merging, and only then deletes.

Never choose a route on the user's behalf: a `LAND` branch by definition carries no PR expressing intent, so the intent has to come from them.

**Retiring is how a `LAND` branch ends, and `dev delete` is not.** A branch the integration branch never absorbed, deleted with no copy on the remote, leaves its commits reachable from nothing and a collector free to take them — and `dev delete` says so only at the moment it does it, which is too late to be a choice. Opening a request and closing it unmerged leaves a copy that outlives the branch: GitHub writes the head of every request to `refs/pull/<number>/head` and keeps it there after the request is closed and after both the branch and origin's copy are deleted. The work survives, and the reason it was dropped sits beside the commits rather than in a session nobody will read again.

**It is only for work the integration branch does not hold.** `dev retire` refuses a branch holding nothing new, because there the commits are already in history, the branch is only a pointer, and `dev delete` is the verb — which is every `DELETE` and `STALE` row. Where a request already exists it reuses it only if it is still open: one that merged or closed cannot be closed again, so anything else gets a fresh request over the same head.

### 7. Merging an open-PR branch

A `KEEP` branch an open PR is driving is not finished work — it is work whose intent is already on record. The question step 6 puts to the user is therefore already answered here: never *whether* to land it, only *when*, and that answer belongs to the sweep as a whole rather than to the branch alone.

**Offer these. Leaving one open is a decision the user makes, not one the sweep makes on their behalf.** Present them as their own group, each with its PR's review decision and check state — `uv run lup-devtools dev pr status --branch <branch> --json` — and ask which to merge. A draft PR, a failing check, or a review still owed are all reasons to leave one standing, and each of them is the user's to weigh.

**They share step 6's queue.** Every merge moves the integration branch, so open-PR branches and `LAND` branches form one ordered sequence rather than two independent passes. Take them one at a time, and re-derive the next one's base after each.

**Order by what the branches touch, not by when they started.** Branches cut from the same tip have no divergence to sort by, so compare their file sets — `git diff --name-only <integration>...<branch>` for each — and read the intersection:

- **Disjoint.** Any order serves. Take the smallest first, so the larger rebases onto a base that has stopped moving.
- **Overlapping source.** Merge the one the other builds on, and expect the second to want a real rebase rather than a fast-forward.
- **Overlapping generated tree.** A generated artifact's contents are derived, so merging two branches' versions as text yields something no generation run ever emitted — resolving cleanly while answering to nothing. Merge whichever regenerates least first, then reconcile the next where this repository's own merge drivers exist: rebase it inside its worktree, regenerate, and let the drift check report that it settled. A merge performed on the host has none of those drivers, because they are per-clone configuration no repository can ship.

Report the comparison and the order it implies, then ask before the first merge. The order is the decision; the merges only carry it out.

### 8. Confirm and execute

Request explicit user approval before deleting a branch, merging a PR, or pushing to a remote. Reason: a LAND branch carries no PR expressing intent, and the order open PRs merge in is the user's to settle, so the intent has to come from them. Then carry out the approved actions.

### 9. Report results

What landed, what merged, what was deleted, and what was deliberately left alone.

## Guidelines

- Never force-delete without explicit user approval for that specific branch
- **Never delete a `LAND` branch unless the user explicitly chose to drop it** — and then retire it rather than deleting it, so the choice ends the branch and not the work
- Skip the current branch — warn the user instead
- Containment counts as landed only against the integration branch; riding inside a sibling that has not landed either is no reason to drop work
- For rebased branches, content may have reached the integration branch via a rebase PR even though `--is-ancestor` is false — the `DELETE` disposition already accounts for merged PRs
