# Install Lup into Target Repo

Install the lup plugin, hooks, and useful scaffolding into an existing repository. Unlike `$lup:init` (which customizes the template for a new domain), this command ports lup capabilities into a repo that already has its own structure and conventions.

## Your Task

**Arguments provided**: the arguments supplied with this skill invocation

### Parse Arguments

- **target-repo**: Path to the target repository (default: `..`). Resolve relative paths from the current working directory.
- **--interactive**: If present, put each porting decision to the user as a choice. If absent, be conservative — modify as few files as possible.

### The source repository is read-only

You are running *inside* the source. Every write this command makes belongs to
the target, and nothing it does may change the checkout it runs from — not a
file, not a git ref, and not a piece of local state.

The failure is quiet rather than loud, which is why it is stated here: a
`lup-devtools` command run without a working directory acts on the current one,
so it lands in the source and looks like it worked. Two habits prevent it:

- Give every command the target explicitly — `git -C <target> …`, and
  `uv run --directory <target> lup-devtools …` for anything that reads or
  writes its state. `--directory` is the flag that changes the working
  directory; `--project` only discovers a manifest and leaves you in the source.
- Write files by absolute path under the target, never by a path relative to
  where you are standing.

Before reporting success, run `git -C <source> status --short` and confirm it
is clean. If the source changed, say so in the report rather than reverting
silently — something wrote where it should not have, and which command did it
is the useful part.

That rule is about *accidental* writes — a command that acted on the wrong
working directory. It does not forbid a deliberate contribution back. When the
target's fork carries code that passes the library placement test — would
another project built on lup want this? — folding it into the source is the
correct outcome rather than a violation. Raise it as a decision; once the user
approves, the source is writable for exactly that change, and the report names
the commits you made to it alongside the ones you made to the target.

### The source branch is part of what you install

Every phase below reads the source checkout as it stands, so the branch you are
standing on *is* the release you are about to install — a feature branch ports
unmerged work, and nothing downstream announces that. Resolve both before
Phase 1:

- `git -C <source> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` — the branch you would port
- `git -C <source> symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` — what the
  remote treats as stable

When they differ, Ask the user directly, offering concrete options, and wait for the answer: whether to install the source's current branch, which carries work the stable branch has not reviewed, or to port from the stable branch instead

Record the branch and commit the answer settles on: every later phase reads
that checkout, and step 9 baselines the target's sync checkpoint at it.

If `the arguments supplied with this skill invocation` is empty, use defaults: target=`..`, non-interactive.

## Phase 1: Analyze Source Repo (Lup Template)

Inventory what the lup plugin offers. Read these key files in the **current** repo (`.`):

### Plugin Structure

One declaration set renders into every harness tree the repo commits, so each
capability below exists once per tree:

| Capability | Where it lands |
| --- | --- |
| Plugin identity | .claude/plugins/lup/.claude-plugin/plugin.json under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/.codex-plugin/plugin.json under Codex |
| Hook definitions, dispatcher, and hermetic policy runtime | .claude/plugins/lup/hooks/ under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/hooks/ under Codex |
| Skills | .claude/plugins/lup/commands/*.md under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/skills/*/SKILL.md under Codex |
| Agents | .claude/plugins/lup/agents/*.md under Claude Code, .codex/agents/*.toml under Codex |
| Guidance template | .claude/plugins/lup/TEMPLATE_CLAUDE.md under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/TEMPLATE_AGENTS.md under Codex |

### Reusable Library Code

- `packages/lup/src/lup/` — utilities (trace, hooks, metrics, mcp, retry, notes, history, paths)
- `lup.workspace.paths.agent_version()` — version tracking pattern (reads `[tool.lup] agent_version` from pyproject.toml)

### How the Target Obtains Lup

A Python target depends on `lup` as a package; it does not receive a copy of
the library's source. Which acquisition mode to declare is a fact you look up,
not a preference — check whether a release exists before deciding:

```
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://pypi.org/pypi/lup/json
```

| Look-up | Mode | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` — a release exists | published | `dev library use published --version <release>` |
| `404` — nothing published yet | **git** | `dev library git --branch <source-branch>` |
| The user is developing both repos at once | linked | `dev library link <source>` |

Prefer the index the moment it can answer, and the repository until it can:
both hand the target a real package, so its `packages/lup/` stays absent and
nothing has to be merged later. Vendoring is not on this list — a vendored copy
is a fork with all the reconciliation that implies, and is only right for a
target that genuinely intends to modify library source.

The git mode resolves `subdirectory = "packages/lup"`, because the distribution
sits inside the repository rather than at its root, and pins whichever ref you
name. **The ref must be reachable on the remote**: a branch that exists only in
the source checkout resolves to whatever the remote last saw, so the target
silently installs an older library. Before declaring a git source, confirm the
commit you settled on before Phase 1 is actually pushed —
`git -C <source> ls-remote origin <branch>` — and stop and say so if it is not,
rather than installing a dependency that cannot see the work being installed.

The extras the target needs come from what it runs: `claude` and/or `codex` for
the adapters it drives, `docker` for the code-execution sandbox, `web` for the
session API. Name them in the requirement (`lup[claude,codex,docker]`).

### DevTools CLI

The `lup-devtools` CLI (`src/lup_template/devtools/`) gives the meta-agent structured commands for development tasks that would otherwise require ad-hoc bash one-liners. Without it, an agent resorts to `python -c "..."` snippets or manual shell pipelines for trace analysis, feedback collection, and session management — which are fragile and unrepeatable. The devtools encode these workflows as proper CLI commands with argument parsing, output formatting, and error handling.

- `src/lup_template/devtools/main.py` — root typer app composing sub-apps (entry point: `lup-devtools`)
  - `agent` — Agent introspection and debugging
  - `dashboard` — Host the local setup dashboard
  - `dev` — Worktrees, branches, and pre-flight checks
  - `feedback` — Feedback state, metrics, and commits
  - `harness` — Generate and launch the native harnesses
  - `py` — Python module introspection
  - `setup` — Interactive setup wizard
  - `sync` — Track sync.json repos and review their commits
  - `trace` — Trace display, search, and analysis
  - `usage` — Runtime usage display
  - `version` — Agent version, changelog, and bump

### Configuration Patterns

- .claude/settings.json under Claude Code, .codex/config.toml under Codex — each tree's project configuration
- `sync.json` — registry of repos tracked for sync

Build a mental inventory of **portable capabilities** organized by category:

1. **Plugin infrastructure**: hooks.json, hook scripts, plugin.json structure
2. **Permission hooks**: auto-allow patterns for shell commands, edits, and network fetches; pre-push quality gates; test protection
3. **Slash commands**: which ones are generic (commit, rebase, close, land, meta, merge, debug, refactor) vs lup-specific (init, feedback-loop, bump, update)
4. **Library utilities**: print_block, TraceLogger, version tracking, retry decorator, cache, hook composition
5. **Guidance patterns**: coding standards, git workflow, editing style, debugging philosophy
6. **DevTools patterns**: CLI structure, sync tracking

## Phase 2: Analyze Target Repo

### First: does the target already have lup?

Installing is one of two jobs this command does. The other is bringing a
target that already has lup up to date, and the two look nothing alike — so
decide which before reading anything else. Run
`uv run --directory <target> lup-devtools dev library status`; where that command
does not exist, look for a `lup` dependency in the target's `pyproject.toml`
and for a vendored `packages/lup/`.

| What the target has | Do this instead of installing |
| --- | --- |
| Nothing | Continue with the phases below — this is a first install. |
| A `lup` dependency resolved from an index, a repository, or a checkout | Nothing to port. Move the release it resolves forward, regenerate its harness, and report. The library arrives as a package; only the target's own declarations are its business. |
| A vendored `packages/lup/` copy | Do **not** overwrite it. Port the upstream commits through $lup:update, which reviews them one at a time against a tree that has diverged on purpose. Read the fork the other way too, before porting anything: run the library placement test over what it *added*, because a downstream that solved a framework problem is holding library code, and that folds back into lup rather than staying forked forever. Then offer to end the fork, saying plainly that it is one-way and worth reviewing: pick the acquisition mode by the § How the Target Obtains Lup table below rather than defaulting to a vendored copy, which is what the fork already is. |
| An old install with no sync baseline | Baseline it first (step 9 below, against the target), so the next review lists commits rather than the entire history. |

A target that already has lup is the common case after the first year, and
overwriting its tree is the one outcome worth ruling out: its declarations
have diverged on purpose, and they are what generation reads.

### Then: read its structure

1. **Top-level layout**: `ls` the root, look for `src/`, `lib/`, `tests/`, any harness tree, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.
2. **Language and ecosystem**: Python/Node/Rust/Go/etc? Package manager? Build tools?
3. **Existing harness setup**: Does it have a guidance file? Project configuration? Any plugins already?
4. **Existing hooks**: Any permission hooks already wired? What patterns do they use?
5. **Existing commands**: Any slash commands already defined?
6. **Git workflow**: How does the repo handle branches, PRs, commits?
7. **Code conventions**: What patterns does the repo follow? Type checking? Linting?

**Key questions to answer:**

- What language/ecosystem is the target? (This determines which library utilities are portable)
- Does it already have a harness tree we'd be extending vs. creating from scratch?
- What existing conventions must be respected?

## Phase 3: Find the Overlap

Based on the analysis, classify each lup capability as:

### Always Portable (language-agnostic)

These work in any repo:

- **Plugin infrastructure**: The plugin directory itself — .claude/plugins/lup/ under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/ under Codex
- **Permission policy**: configure URL scopes, protected roots, and the target's own shell vocabulary in the canonical `HookSet`; change semantic decisions in `lup.policy`, then regenerate
- **Pre-push quality gates**: Adapt to target's linter/type-checker/test runner
- **Generic commands**: commit, rebase, close, land, meta, debug, refactor, add-command, modify-command, merge, principle, review, create-investigator
- **Guidance patterns**: Git workflow, editing style, asking questions, debugging philosophy
- **Settings patterns**: the permission structure in each tree's project configuration

### Portable if Python

These port well to other Python projects:

- **Library utilities**: hook composition, version tracking, retry, cache
- **DevTools CLI**: The `lup-devtools` typer app structure — `main.py` composing sub-apps, `pyproject.toml` entry point. Even if the target doesn't need every subcommand, the skeleton (dev, py, sync, usage, version) gives the meta-agent reliable tooling instead of ad-hoc scripts.
- **Upstream sync**: sync.json + sync commands (`lup-devtools sync`)

### Portable if SDK agent

If the target repo builds (or will build) a tool-using SDK agent, the **self-improvement loop scaffolding** is the core value of lup — these are high-priority to port:

- **Agent scaffolding**: core.py pattern (orchestration), subagents.py, models.py (structured output), prompts.py, tool_policy.py, config.py (pydantic-settings)
- **Feedback loop**: feedback collection, trace analysis, metrics aggregation, scoring CSV
- **Session management**: CLI with `run` + `loop` commands, auto-commit, session storage
- **DevTools**: The full `lup-devtools` CLI (`agent`, `dashboard`, `dev`, `feedback`, `harness`, `py`, `setup`, `sync`, `trace`, `usage`, `version`)
- **Version tracking**: `[tool.lup] agent_version` in pyproject.toml + `lup-devtools version bump` for tracking agent behavior changes
- **Commands**: `init`, `feedback-loop`, `bump`, `update` — the self-improvement workflow
- **Template guidance**: Section-level merge into each guidance file the target carries, from its matching template flavor (add missing sections, leave existing ones)

When the target has SDK agent code, adapt the scaffolding to wrap their existing agent — don't replace it. The lup patterns (trace logging, scoring, feedback collection) layer on top of whatever agent they already have.

These patterns are **opt-in, not a bundle**: reflection, realtime/persistent mode, the feedback loop, and the commit loop each port only if the target actually needs them (see the guidance file's § Scaffolding Is a Menu, Not a Mandate). Don't install a pattern the target won't use — dead scaffolding is worse than a capability you can add later.

### Skip (never port)

- Domain-specific tool implementations (example.py contents)
- Domain-specific prompt content
- Domain-specific model fields (but port the pattern/structure)

## Phase 4: Decide Plugin Strategy

lup renders one declaration set into every harness tree, so first settle which
trees the target carries: Ask the user directly, offering concrete options, and wait for the answer: which harness trees the target should carry — one runtime's, or every runtime it uses In non-interactive mode, install the trees the target already shows evidence
of, and every tree when it shows none.

Then determine **where** the plugin goes. Two options:

### Option A: Install lup as its own plugin (preferred)

Create the plugin directory in each selected tree (.claude/plugins/lup/ under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/ under Codex) as a standalone local plugin in the target repo. Per tree, this requires:

1. **Plugin manifest** (.claude/plugins/lup/.claude-plugin/plugin.json under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/.codex-plugin/plugin.json under Codex) — the plugin entry's `name` stays `lup`, so every skill keeps its `lup:` qualifier.
2. **Marketplace registration** (.claude/plugins/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json under Claude Code, .agents/plugins/marketplace.json under Codex) with a **project-unique** `name` (use the target's package/repo name, e.g. `myproject`), listing the `lup` plugin:
   ```json
   { "name": "myproject", "plugins": [{ "name": "lup", "source": "./lup" }] }
   ```
3. **Register + enable** it in that tree's project configuration (.claude/settings.json under Claude Code, .codex/config.toml under Codex) under the same unique name. Each runtime spells this differently — read
   this repo's own configuration for the worked example rather than reciting one
   from memory. On a Python target where `lup-devtools` is installed,
   `lup-devtools dev plugin name` does steps 2–3 automatically (default name:
   the target's `[project].name`).

**Never name the marketplace `lup` or `local`.** Marketplace names share one global namespace per runtime, so a shared name collides across every repo that registers it — an install from one repo silently shadows the others. The plugin entry stays `lup`; only the *marketplace* is named per-project.

### Option B: Merge into an existing plugin

If the target already has a local plugin of its own, offer to merge lup's hooks and skills into it. This avoids a second plugin but mixes namespaces. Only do this in interactive mode when the user explicitly chooses it.

**In non-interactive mode, always use Option A.**

When the target already has other local plugins, lup installs alongside them under its own project-named marketplace — no conflict.

## Phase 5: Decide What to Install

Use your judgment based on what you found in Phases 1-3. The analysis should drive the decisions — don't follow a fixed checklist.

### Non-Interactive Mode (default)

Be conservative — only install what clearly adds value. Typical candidates (but decide based on the actual target):

- **Plugin infrastructure**: plugin.json, hooks.json, settings.json (project-named marketplace + plugin enablement)
- **Permission hooks** adapted to the target's ecosystem (its build tool, test runner, linter, doc URLs)
- **Generic skills** that work in any repo (git workflow, guidance maintenance, meta, refactor, etc.)
- **Guidance file**: Perform a **section-level merge** from each tree's template flavor (.claude/plugins/lup/TEMPLATE_CLAUDE.md under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/TEMPLATE_AGENTS.md under Codex) into that tree's guidance file (.claude/CLAUDE.md under Claude Code, AGENTS.md under Codex). Read the template, use the `<!-- section: ... -->` markers to identify independent merge units, adapt for the target's project name and ecosystem, then compare marked sections against the target's existing guidance file. Add sections that are missing; leave existing sections untouched. If no guidance file exists, create one from the adapted template.
- **If SDK agent detected**: Also install the self-improvement scaffolding — this is lup's core value. The feedback loop commands, lib utilities (trace, scoring, metrics, hooks, version), devtools CLI pattern, session/trace directory structure, sync.json for upstream sync. Adapt to layer on top of the target's existing agent, not replace it.

**Constraints** in non-interactive mode:

- Don't rewrite the target's existing guidance content or change existing hooks and skills
- Don't install anything requiring new dependencies (suggest them in the report)
- Don't modify existing source code files (only create new files)

### Interactive Mode

Ask at decision points where the user's input matters — don't ask about things you can decide confidently from the analysis, and don't enumerate every file individually.

Group decisions at meaningful levels. Examples of the _kinds_ of things to surface:

- Plugin strategy (own plugin vs merge) when the target already has plugins
- Which capability categories to install when the target could use some but not all
- How to handle the target's guidance file when it already states different conventions
- Whether/how to port SDK agent scaffolding when the target has existing agent code
- Whether to restructure existing code to fit lup patterns or layer on top
- Offering rewrites or retemplating of existing files when they'd benefit from lup patterns

What questions to ask — and how many — depends entirely on what you found. A bare repo with no harness tree needs fewer questions than one with an established plugin ecosystem.

## Phase 6: Execute Installation

For each item being installed:

1. **Read the source file** from the current repo
2. **Adapt it** for the target:
   - Replace `uv run` with target's equivalent (npm run, cargo, make, etc.) in hooks and commands
   - Adjust file path patterns in hooks for target's directory structure
   - Keep command markdown structure but update tool references and examples
   - Walk the `TEMPLATE:` markers in ported scaffolding files — each marks a domain decision with a one-line description. Adapt the code a marker points at to the target (and remove the marker), or leave it in place as an open decision the target gathers later with `uv run lup-devtools dev todos`
3. **Write to the target repo** — create directories as needed
4. **Never overwrite** existing files without asking (even in non-interactive mode, warn and skip)

### Renaming Rules

**Only Python import paths change** to match the target's package name. All framework vocabulary stays as `lup`:

| Changes (adapt to target package) | Stays as `lup` (framework identity) |
|---|---|
| `from lup_template.*` → `from <target>.*` imports | `lup-devtools` CLI entry point name |
| `src/lup_template/` → `src/<target>/` paths | `@lup_tool(...)`, `LupMcpTool` |
| `pyproject.toml` package name | the plugin directory in each tree |
| marketplace `name` (marketplace.json) → `<target>` | plugin entry `name`: `lup` (so `$lup:*` is stable) |
| Main CLI entry point name | `.lup/` state directory |
| Logger module paths | `lup-tools`, `lup-sandbox-*`, `lup-mcp-*` |
| | Naming convention ("Lup" = inner agent) |

### Installation Order

Steps 1-4, 6 and 7 repeat per selected tree; step 5 is tree-independent.

1. Plugin manifest — .claude/plugins/lup/.claude-plugin/plugin.json under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/.codex-plugin/plugin.json under Codex
2. Hook definitions and adapted hook scripts — .claude/plugins/lup/hooks/ under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/hooks/ under Codex (only reference hooks being installed)
3. Marketplace registration — .claude/plugins/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json under Claude Code, .agents/plugins/marketplace.json under Codex
4. Selected skills — .claude/plugins/lup/commands/ under Claude Code, .codex/plugins/lup/skills/ under Codex
5. `src/<project>/devtools/` — devtools CLI skeleton (if Python target, adapt import paths but keep `lup-devtools` as the CLI entry point name), and the `lup` requirement itself in the target's `pyproject.toml`, declared through the mode § How the Target Obtains Lup settled on
6. Project configuration — .claude/settings.json under Claude Code, .codex/config.toml under Codex — create or merge
7. Guidance file — .claude/CLAUDE.md under Claude Code, AGENTS.md under Codex — section-level merge from that tree's template flavor (read template → use `<!-- section: ... -->` markers to identify merge units → adapt for target → compare sections → add missing ones → leave existing untouched)
8. **Hand off to generation**: everything written in steps 1-4, 6 and 7 becomes a generated artifact once the target's harness runs. From here on, the target edits its declarations under `src/<project>/devtools/harness/content/` and regenerates with `uv run lup-devtools harness generate all`; the installed files are outputs, and a hand edit to one is reverted the next time generation runs. Say so explicitly in the Phase 7 report.
9. **Initialize upstream sync**: baseline the target at *the commit you ported from*, not at whatever the remote's default branch points to. Run `uv run --directory <target> lup-devtools sync setup lup <source> --branch <source-branch> --synced` — `setup` records the source checkout, the branch settled before Phase 1, and that checkout's HEAD as the checkpoint, so `$lup:update` only shows commits after installation. Plain `sync mark-synced lup` is wrong here: the shipped `sync.json` entry carries a URL and no branch, so it clones the remote's default branch and checkpoints *that* HEAD — every commit you just installed comes back as unported work once your branch merges.

## Phase 7: Verify & Report

After installation:

1. **List all files created/modified** in the target repo, marking which ones generation now owns
2. **Show a summary** of what was installed and why
3. **Note what was skipped** and why (especially in non-interactive mode)
4. **Suggest next steps**:
   - Review the installed hooks and adjust patterns
   - Try `$lup:meta` to review the generated harness trees
   - Run `$lup:commit` to test the commit workflow
   - Consider `$lup:update` later for ongoing sync

## Guidelines

- **Respect the target**: Don't impose lup conventions where the target has its own. Adapt to them.
- **Minimal footprint**: In non-interactive mode, prefer doing less. The user can always run with `--interactive` later to add more.
- **No new dependencies**: Don't install anything that requires `pip install` or `npm install` unless explicitly approved in interactive mode.
- **Adapt, don't copy**: Every file needs to be reviewed and adapted for the target's ecosystem.
- **Preserve existing work**: Never overwrite files a harness tree already holds. Merge or extend.
- **Explain decisions**: For each installed item, briefly explain what it does and why it helps.
